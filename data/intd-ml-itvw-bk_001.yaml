- en: As a candidate, I’ve interviewed at a dozen big companies and startups. I’ve
    got offers for machine learning roles at companies including Google, NVIDIA, Snap,
    Netflix, Primer AI, and Snorkel AI. I’ve also been rejected at many other companies.

  zh: 作为候选人，我在十几家大公司和初创公司进行了面试。我收到了包括谷歌、英伟达、Snap、Netflix、Primer AI和Snorkel AI在内的公司在机器学习职位上的工作机会。我也在其他许多公司遭到了拒绝。
- en: As an interviewer, I’ve been involved in designing and executing the hiring
    process at NVIDIA and Snorkel AI, having taken steps from cold emailing candidates
    whose work I love, screening resumes, doing exploratory and technical interviews,
    debating whether or not to hire a candidate, to trying to convince candidates
    to choose us over competitive offers.

  zh: 作为面试官，我参与了英伟达和Snorkel AI的招聘流程的设计和执行，从向那些我热爱其工作的候选人发送冷邮件，筛选简历，进行探索性和技术面试，讨论是否要雇佣候选人，到试图说服候选人选择我们而不是竞争性报价。
- en: As a friend and teacher, I’ve helped many friends and students prepare for their
    machine learning interviews at big companies and startups. I give them mock interviews
    and take notes of the process they went through as well as the questions they
    were asked.

  zh: 作为朋友和老师，我帮助许多朋友和学生为大公司和初创公司准备机器学习面试。我给他们进行模拟面试，并记录他们经历的过程以及他们被问到的问题。
- en: I’ve also consulted several startups on their machine learning hiring pipelines.
    Hiring for machine learning roles turned out to be pretty difficult when you don’t
    already have a strong in-house machine learning team and process to help you evaluate
    candidates. As the use of machine learning in the industry is still pretty new,
    a lot of companies are still making it up as they go along, which doesn’t make
    it easier for candidates.

  zh: 我还咨询了几家初创公司关于他们的机器学习招聘流程。在没有强大的内部机器学习团队和流程来帮助你评估候选人的情况下，招聘机器学习职位变得相当困难。由于机器学习在行业中的应用仍然相对较新，许多公司仍在边走边摸索，这并没有让候选人更容易。
- en: This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat
    on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the
    hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who
    saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies
    are hiring, and to rethink their own process.

  zh: 这本书是许多人在面试桌的两侧坐下并花费大量时间思考招聘过程的结果。它是以候选人为出发点编写的，但看到早期草稿的招聘经理告诉我，他们发现了解其他公司的招聘方式以及重新思考自己的流程很有帮助。
- en: The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine
    learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available,
    what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how
    to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what
    kind of signals they look for.

  zh: 本书分为两部分。第一部分概述了机器学习面试流程，包括哪些类型的机器学习职位可用，每个职位需要哪些技能，常见的问题类型以及如何准备这些问题。这部分还解释了面试官的心态以及他们寻找的信号。
- en: The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its
    level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions
    -- that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.

  zh: 第二部分包含超过200个知识问题，每个问题都标注了其难度级别——对于更高层次的职位面试应预期更难的问题——涵盖了机器学习中的重要概念和常见误解。
- en: After you've finished this book, you might want to checkout [the 30 open-ended
    questions](https://huyenchip.com/machine-learning-systems-design/toc.html) to
    test your ability to put together what you know to solve practical challenges.
    These questions test your problem-solving skills as well as the extent of your
    experiences in implementing and deploying machine learning models. Some companies
    call them **machine learning systems design** questions. Almost all companies
    I’ve talked to ask at least a question of this type in their interview process,
    and they are the questions that candidates often find to be the hardest.

  zh: 在你完成这本书之后，你可能想查看[30个开放性问题](https://huyenchip.com/machine-learning-systems-design/toc.html)来测试你将所学知识组合起来解决实际挑战的能力。这些问题测试了你的问题解决技能以及你在实施和部署机器学习模型方面的经验范围。一些公司称它们为**机器学习系统设计**问题。我交谈过的几乎所有公司都在他们的面试过程中至少问过这类问题，而且这些通常是候选人认为最困难的问题。
- en: '“Machine learning systems design” is an intricate topic that merits its own
    book. To learn more about it, check out my course [**CS 329S: Machine learning
    systems design**](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/) at Stanford.'

  zh: “机器学习系统设计”是一个复杂的话题，值得有一本自己的书。要了解更多关于它的信息，请查看我在斯坦福的[**CS 329S：机器学习系统设计**](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/)课程。
- en: This book is not a replacement to machine learning textbooks nor a shortcut
    to game the interviews. It’s a tool to consolidate your existing theoretical and
    practical knowledge in machine learning. The questions in this book can also help
    identify your blind/weak spots. Each topic is accompanied by resources that should
    help you strengthen your understanding of that topic.

  zh: 本书不是机器学习教科书的替代品，也不是面试的捷径。它是一个工具，用于巩固你在机器学习方面的现有理论和实践知识。本书中的问题也有助于识别你的盲点/弱点。每个主题都附有资源，可以帮助你加强对该主题的理解。
