- en: Companies want to know about you, your personality, your grit, your strengths,
    and your weaknesses. Directly asking a candidate for their strengths and weaknesses
    often yields poor results -- most people are reluctant to admit their flaws and
    too shy to boast about their strengths. Interviewers, therefore, might frame the
    questions differently.

  zh: 公司想了解你，你的个性，你的毅力，你的优点和缺点。直接询问候选人的优点和缺点通常会导致结果不佳——大多数人都不愿意承认自己的缺点，也太害羞去夸耀自己的优点。因此，面试官可能会以不同的方式提出问题。

- en: 'Senior interviewers tend to have a go-to question that they believe reveals
    the most about a person. In his book *Zero to One*, Peter Thiel revealed that
    he asked everyone he interviewed: “*What important truth do very few people agree
    with you on?*” This question is hard to answer as it first requires you to know
    what most people agree on, be able to think independently and be confident enough
    to express it.'

  zh: 高级面试官往往有一个他们认为能揭示一个人最多信息的固定问题。在他的书《从零到一》中，彼得·蒂尔透露，他向所有面试的人都问过：“*有什么重要的真理是很少有人与你意见一致的？*”这个问题很难回答，因为它首先要求你了解大多数人同意什么，能够独立思考，并且有足够的自信来表达它。
- en: Be yourself, but don’t be a jerk. Silicon Valley has been known for tolerating
    brilliant jerks -- high performers who are rude and unpleasant to work with --
    which contributes to the alleged toxic culture of the tech industry. However,
    in recent years, many tech companies including Netflix have made the commitment
    to not hire jerks, no matter how brilliant they are.

  zh: 做你自己，但不要成为一个混蛋。硅谷一直以容忍杰出的混蛋而闻名——这些混蛋是表现优异但粗鲁且令人不愉快的同事，这导致了科技行业所谓的有毒文化。然而，近年来，包括Netflix在内的许多科技公司都承诺不雇佣混蛋，无论他们多么有才华。
