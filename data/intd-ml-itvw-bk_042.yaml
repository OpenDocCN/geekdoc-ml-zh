- en: One common question that a lot of interviewers start with is “Tell me about
    yourself”. You should come up with an under-a-minute answer and practice it beforehand.
    Your answer should be both personal (you’re you and nobody else) and professional
    (why you’re a good fit for the role). Your answer might guide the rest of the
    interview.

  zh: 许多面试官通常会从“请告诉我关于你自己”这个问题开始。你应该想出一个不到一分钟的回答并在事先练习。你的回答应该是既个人的（你是你，没有人是别人）又专业的（为什么你适合这个角色）。你的回答可能会引导整个面试。
- en: 'Interviewers might also test your general level of expertise with the question:
    “What level of involvement have you had with [ML|computer vision|natural language
    processing|etc.]?” Don’t bluff. If you pretend that you’re more experienced than
    you actually are, the interviewer will find out.'

  zh: 面试官也可能通过以下问题来测试你对一般专业水平的了解：“你在[机器学习|计算机视觉|自然语言处理|等]方面有多少参与？”不要吹牛。如果你假装比你实际经验更丰富，面试官会发现。
- en: Companies will want to know about your career history. They will probably ask
    about your educational background, your previous jobs, and your past projects.
    You should highlight two things. O**ne is the decisions you made at each position
    that had an impact, both positive and negative. Another is why you decided to
    leave one company to join the next.**

  zh: 公司会想知道你的职业历史。他们可能会询问你的教育背景、以前的工作和过去的项目。你应该突出两点。一是你在每个职位上做出的有影响的决策，无论是积极的还是消极的。二是你为什么决定离开一家公司加入下一家。
- en: The interviewer will try to see if you’ve done what you claim on your resume.
    If you have, how much ownership you took. It’s pretty easy to spot the talkers
    from the doers just by asking for details. They might pick up one project from
    your resume and make you explain every choice you made in it. If you claim to
    be familiar with TensorFlow, be prepared to talk about eager execution, tf.estimator,
    and distributed training in TensorFlow.

  zh: 面试官会试图看看你是否在你简历上声称的事情上有所行动。如果你有，你承担了多少责任。仅通过询问细节，就可以很容易地分辨出那些空谈者和那些实干者。他们可能会从你的简历中挑选一个项目，并让你解释你在其中做出的每一个选择。如果你声称熟悉TensorFlow，那么你准备好讨论TensorFlow中的即时执行、tf.estimator和分布式训练了。
- en: 'Employers will of course want to know about your current job search: why are
    you looking and what are you looking for. A question that every company asks is
    whether you have any impending offer/deadline that they should be aware of. Some
    candidates feel awkward to admit that they don’t have any offer yet for fear that
    the company will think less of them. Some resort to lying, telling recruiters
    that they have impending onsites or offers when they don’t.'

  zh: 雇主当然会想知道你的当前求职情况：你为什么在寻找工作，你在寻找什么。每个公司都会问的一个问题是，你是否有什么即将到来的出价/截止日期，他们应该知道。一些候选人可能会感到尴尬，承认他们还没有任何出价，担心公司会看轻他们。有些人会撒谎，告诉招聘人员他们有即将到来的现场面试或出价，尽管他们没有。
- en: You might be able to get away with it -- some even argue that since companies
    regularly take advantage of their users and employees, we have no ethical obligation
    to be honest with them. However, it’s a slippery slope. I wouldn’t want to be
    the person who lies to get ahead, but it’s a personal decision each of us has
    to make for ourselves.

  zh: 你可能可以侥幸逃脱——有些人甚至认为，由于公司经常利用他们的用户和员工，我们没有道德义务对他们诚实。然而，这是一个危险的斜坡。我不想成为那种为了成功而撒谎的人，但这是我们每个人必须为自己做出的个人决定。
