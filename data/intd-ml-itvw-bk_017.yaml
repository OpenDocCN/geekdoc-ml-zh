- en: ML engineering is considered a subfield of software engineering. In most organizations,
    the hiring process for MLEs is spun out of their existing SWE hiring process.
    Some organizations might swap out a few SWE questions for ML-specific questions.
    Some just add an interview specially focused on ML on top of their existing interview
    process for SWE, making their MLE process a bit longer than their SWE process.

  zh: 机器学习工程被认为是软件工程的子领域。在大多数组织中，机器学习工程师（MLE）的招聘流程是从他们现有的软件工程师（SWE）招聘流程中分离出来的。一些组织可能会用一些针对机器学习的特定问题替换掉几个SWE问题。一些组织只是在现有的SWE面试流程上增加一个专门针对机器学习的面试，这使得他们的MLE流程比SWE流程要长一些。
- en: Overall, MLE candidates are expected to know how to code and be familiar with
    software engineering tools. Many traditional SWE tools can be used to develop
    and deploy ML applications.

  zh: 总体而言，机器学习工程师候选人应了解如何编码，并熟悉软件工程工具。许多传统的SWE工具可以用来开发和部署机器学习应用。
- en: In the early days of ML adoption, when companies had little understanding of
    what ML production entailed, many used to expect MLE candidates to be both stellar
    software engineers and stellar ML researchers. However, finding a candidate fitting
    that profile turned out to be difficult, and many companies had relaxed their
    ML criteria. In fact, several hiring managers have told me that they’d rather
    hire people who are great engineers but don’t know much ML because it’s easier
    for great engineers to pick up ML than for ML experts to pick up good engineering
    practices.

  zh: 在机器学习早期应用阶段，当公司对机器学习生产过程了解不多时，许多公司曾期望机器学习工程师（MLE）候选人既是杰出的软件工程师，又是杰出的机器学习研究者。然而，找到符合这种描述的候选人证明是困难的，许多公司已经放宽了他们的机器学习标准。实际上，几位招聘经理告诉我，他们更愿意雇佣那些是优秀工程师但对机器学习了解不多的人，因为优秀的工程师学习机器学习比机器学习专家学习良好的工程实践要容易得多。
