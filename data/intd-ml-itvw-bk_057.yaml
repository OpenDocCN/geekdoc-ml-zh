- en: Companies expect you to negotiate. The initial offers are designed to make room
    for that. They offer the smallest amount you’d accept, not what is fair. I’ve
    seen candidates who had their offers doubled through negotiation. I’ve also seen
    people getting paid $100K/year less than their peers because they didn’t.

  zh: 公司期望你进行谈判。最初的报价是为了留出空间。他们提供的金额是你能接受的最低金额，而不是公平的金额。我见过通过谈判将报价翻倍的人。我也见过有些人因为不谈判而比他们的同事少赚10万美元/年。
- en: Negotiation is stressful. “How much should I ask for?” “Am I being lowballed?”
    “What if they rescind the offer because they think I’m being greedy?” In case
    you’re worried about the last question, relax. If you’re respectful during your
    negotiation, companies won’t rescind their offers. If they do, it’s not a company
    you want to work for.

  zh: 谈判是有压力的。“我应该要求多少？”“我是不是被压价了？”“如果他们认为我贪婪而撤回报价怎么办？”如果你担心最后一个问题，请放松。如果你在谈判中保持尊重，公司不会撤回他们的报价。如果他们撤回了，那不是你想要工作的公司。
- en: When negotiating, it’s important to know how much other people are getting paid
    and how much you should get paid. The employer has this information since they’ve
    negotiated with many candidates before, but most of us only negotiate with a handful
    of employers during our entire life. This imbalance of information gives employers
    more leverage. It especially hurts candidates of underrepresented groups who don’t
    have access to people who can guide them through the process.

  zh: 在谈判时，了解其他人赚多少钱以及你应该赚多少钱非常重要。雇主有这些信息，因为他们已经与许多候选人谈判过，但大多数人在一生中只与少数雇主谈判。这种信息不平衡给了雇主更多的优势。这尤其伤害了那些没有途径获得指导的人的候选人群体。

  zh: 你可以采取几种方式来收集更多信息：
- en: 'Ask your peers, especially those who have worked/received offers for similar
    positions at similar companies. In many societies, there’s a stigma against discussing
    money. If you ask your friends, don’t ask to satisfy your curiosity. Explain how
    their answers can help you make important decisions. You can also ask for their
    opinions without asking them how much they make. For example: ask them for level
    X at company Y, what’s the range of compensation you should expect, or tell them
    your offer and ask them if they think it’s fair.'

  zh: 向你的同事询问，尤其是那些在类似公司担任过/接受过类似职位邀请的人。在许多社会中，讨论金钱是有耻辱感的。如果你向朋友询问，不要只是为了满足你的好奇心。解释他们的回答如何帮助你做出重要决定。你也可以询问他们的意见，而无需知道他们赚多少钱。例如：询问他们在公司Y的X级职位上，应该期望的薪酬范围是多少，或者告诉他们你的报价，并询问他们认为这是否公平。
- en: Check what other people are getting paid online. There have been several efforts
    to democratize the compensation information, most notable is levels.fyi where
    people can share their compensation details anonymously and you can see the range
    of compensation for certain levels at certain companies. There are also apps like
    Blind that allow you to anonymously share and get feedback on your offers.

  zh: 在线查看其他人赚多少钱。已经有一些努力使薪酬信息民主化，最著名的是levels.fyi，人们可以匿名分享他们的薪酬细节，你可以看到某些公司在某些级别的薪酬范围。还有像Blind这样的应用程序，允许你匿名分享并获取对你报价的反馈。
- en: See how much other companies offer you. One reason to start your job search
    early is that you’ll have more time to shop for offers. If you can get one offer,
    you can get another offer. After three offers, you should have a rough idea. Having
    competing offers helps a lot with negotiation. Companies always match offers,
    even if they say they don’t.

  zh: 看看其他公司给你提供多少。开始你的工作搜索越早，你就有更多时间寻找报价。如果你能获得一个报价，你就能获得另一个报价。在收到三个报价后，你应该有一个大致的了解。拥有竞争报价对谈判有很大帮助。公司总是匹配报价，即使他们说他们不会。

    more flexibility at work, a better title, more conferences they’ll sponsor you
    to attend.
