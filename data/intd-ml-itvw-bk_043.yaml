- en: 'Joshua Levy, a founding engineer at the AI-power SaaS company BloomReach, said
    his go-to interest question is: “*Think of a period when you were thrilled and
    excited to go to work. What made you excited?*” Was it the problem you were trying
    to solve, the impact you could make, the technologies you had access to, the people
    you worked with, your learning curve, or something else?'

  zh: Joshua Levy，AI 力量 SaaS 公司 BloomReach 的创始人工程师，表示他最喜欢的兴趣问题是：“*回想一下你兴奋地去上班的时期。是什么让你感到兴奋？*”是你要解决的问题、你能产生的影响、你能接触到的技术、你合作的同事、你的学习曲线，还是其他什么？
- en: One pet question for many interviewers is “*explain a paper that you really
    like*.” This answer shows not only the kind of problems you’re interested in,
    but also how far you’re willing to go to understand a problem, and how well you
    communicate technical concepts. It doesn’t matter what paper you pick, as long
    as you understand it enough to talk about it. Before your interviews, choose any
    paper, read it inside out and implement it yourself to understand all the subtleties.

  zh: 许多面试官的一个常见问题是“*解释一篇你真正喜欢的论文*。”这个答案不仅显示了你对哪些问题的兴趣，还展示了你愿意走多远去理解一个问题，以及你如何有效地传达技术概念。无论你选择哪篇论文，只要你足够理解它，能够谈论它即可。在面试之前，选择任何一篇论文，彻底阅读并亲自实现它，以理解所有的细微之处。
- en: 'My personal favorite is: “*What have you done that you’re most proud of?*”
    The answer to this question doesn’t even have to be technical. I once told an
    interviewer that I’m most proud of the non-profit organization I started in high-school
    to encourage young people to explore outside their comfort zone. I got an offer.'

  zh: 我个人的最爱是：“*你做过什么让你最自豪的事情？*”这个问题的答案甚至不必是技术性的。我曾经告诉一个面试官，我最自豪的是我在高中时创立的非营利组织，旨在鼓励年轻人探索他们的舒适区之外。我得到了一份工作机会。
- en: 'Interviewers want to get a sense of who you are: what motivates you to do your
    best work, how you handle obstacles. Employers want you to overcome obstacles
    and do your best work at their companies. Companies want passionate people, so
    talk about things that can bring out the fire in your eyes.'

  zh: 面试官想要了解你是谁：是什么激励你做到最好，你如何处理障碍。雇主希望你在他们的公司克服障碍，做到最好。公司希望有激情的人，所以谈谈那些能让你眼中闪烁火花的事情。
