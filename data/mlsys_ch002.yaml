- en: AI is bound to transform the world in profound ways, much like computers and
    the Internet revolutionized every aspect of society in the 20th century. From
    systems that generate creative content like text and images to those driving breakthroughs
    in drug discovery and scientific research, AI is ushering in a new era—one that
    promises to be even more transformative in its scope and impact. But how do we
    make it accessible to everyone?

  zh: 人工智能注定将以深刻的方式改变世界，就像计算机和互联网在20世纪革命性地改变了社会的每一个方面一样。从生成文本和图像等创造性内容的系统到推动药物发现和科学研究突破的系统，人工智能正在引领一个新时代——一个在范围和影响上可能更加变革性的时代。但是，我们如何让它对每个人来说都触手可及呢？
- en: 'With its transformative power comes an equally great responsibility for those
    who access it or work with it. Just as we expect companies to wield their influence
    ethically, those of us in academia bear a parallel responsibility: to share our
    knowledge openly, so it benefits everyone—not just a select few. This conviction
    inspired the creation of this book—an open-source resource aimed at making AI
    education, particularly in AI engineering and systems, inclusive, and accessible
    to everyone from all walks of life.'

  zh: 随着其变革力量的到来，那些使用它或与之合作的人也承担着同样重大的责任。正如我们期望公司以道德的方式行使他们的影响力一样，我们这些学术界的人也承担着相应的责任：公开分享我们的知识，使其惠及每个人——而不仅仅是少数人。这种信念激励了这本书的创建——一个开源资源，旨在使人工智能教育，尤其是人工智能工程和系统，对所有行业的人都是包容的和可访问的。
- en: 'My passion for creating, curating, and editing this content has been deeply
    influenced by landmark textbooks that have profoundly shaped both my academic
    and personal journey. Whether I studied them cover to cover or drew insights from
    key passages, these resources fundamentally shaped the way I think. I reflect
    on the books that guided my path: works by Turing Award winners such as David
    Patterson and John Hennessy—pioneers in computer architecture and system design—and
    foundational research papers by luminaries like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and
    Yoshua Bengio, who pioneered modern deep learning. In some small part, my hope
    is that this book will inspire students to chart their own unique paths.'

  zh: 我对创造、编辑和整理这些内容的热情深受那些深刻塑造了我的学术和个人旅程的里程碑式教科书的影响。无论是从头到尾研读它们，还是从关键段落中汲取灵感，这些资源从根本上塑造了我的思维方式。我反思了引导我道路的书籍：图灵奖得主大卫·帕特森和约翰·亨尼斯的作品——计算机架构和系统设计的先驱——以及像杨立昆、杰弗里·辛顿和约书亚·本吉奥这样的杰出人物的基础性研究论文，他们开创了现代深度学习。在某种程度上，我的希望是这本书能够激励学生规划他们自己独特的道路。
- en: I am optimistic about what lies ahead for AI. It has the potential to solve
    global challenges and unlock creativity in ways we have yet to imagine. To achieve
    this, however, we must train the next generation of AI engineers and practitioners—those
    who can transform novel AI algorithms into scalable, reliable systems that work
    in real-world environments. This book is a step toward curating the material needed
    to build the next generation of AI engineers who will transform today’s visions
    into tomorrow’s reality.

  zh: 我对人工智能的未来持乐观态度。它有潜力以我们尚未想象的方式解决全球挑战并激发创造力。然而，为了实现这一目标，我们必须培养下一代人工智能工程师和实践者——那些能够将新颖的人工智能算法转化为可扩展、可靠的系统，并在现实世界环境中运行的人。这本书就是朝着构建下一代人工智能工程师迈出的一步，他们将把今天的愿景转化为明天的现实。
- en: 'This book is a work in progress, but knowing that even one learner benefits
    from its content motivates me to continually refine and expand it. To that end,
    if there’s one thing I ask of readers, it’s this: please show your support by
    starring the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book).
    Your star ⭐ reflects your belief in this mission—not just to me, but to the growing
    global community of learners, educators, and practitioners. This small act is
    more than symbolic—it amplifies the importance of making AI education accessible.'

  zh: 这本书仍在不断完善中，但知道即使一个学习者从其内容中受益，这也激励我不断改进和扩展它。为此，如果读者们能做一件事，那就是：请通过在这里[GitHub仓库](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book)上给这本书加星来表示您的支持。您的星号⭐反映了您对这个使命的信念——不仅是对我，也是对日益增长的全球学习者、教育者和实践者社区。这一小举动不仅仅具有象征意义——它放大了使人工智能教育可访问的重要性。
- en: I am a student of my own writing, and every chapter of this book has taught
    me something new—thanks to the numerous people who have played, and continue to
    play, an important role in shaping this work. Professors, students, practitioners,
    and researchers contributed by offering suggestions, sharing expertise, identifying
    errors, and proposing improvements. Every interaction, from detailed critiques
    to simple corrections, has been a lesson in collaborative knowledge creation.
    These contributions have not only refined the material but also deepened my understanding
    of how knowledge grows through collaboration. This book is, therefore, not solely
    my work; it is a shared endeavor, reflecting the collective spirit of those dedicated
    to sharing their knowledge and effort.

  zh: 我是我自己写作的学生，这本书的每一章都教会了我新的东西——感谢那些在塑造这项工作中扮演并继续扮演重要角色的众多人。教授们、学生、实践者和研究人员通过提出建议、分享专业知识、识别错误和提出改进意见做出了贡献。从详细的批评到简单的纠正，每一次互动都是协作知识创造的教训。这些贡献不仅完善了材料，也加深了我对知识如何通过协作增长的理解。因此，这本书不仅仅是我的作品；它是一个共同的努力，反映了那些致力于分享知识和努力的集体精神。
- en: This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my father. His passion for education,
    endless curiosity, generosity in sharing knowledge, and unwavering commitment
    to quality challenge me daily to strive for excellence in all I do. In his honor,
    I extend this dedication to teachers and mentors everywhere, whose efforts and
    guidance transform lives every day. Your selfless contributions remind me to persevere.
