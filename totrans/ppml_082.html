<h1>Two-way communication</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/07_threads/07_ack.html">https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/07_threads/07_ack.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>In our current client-server implementation, communication flows in one direction: from the client to the server.<br/>
The client has no way of knowing if the server received the message, executed it successfully, or failed.
That's not ideal.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we can introduce a two-way communication system.</p>
<h2 id="response-channel"><a class="header" href="#response-channel">Response channel</a></h2>
<p>We need a way for the server to send a response back to the client.<br/>
There are various ways to do this, but the simplest option is to include a <code>Sender</code> channel in
the message that the client sends to the server. After processing the message, the server can use
this channel to send a response back to the client.</p>
<p>This is a fairly common pattern in Rust applications built on top of message-passing primitives.</p>
