- en: Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and
    engineering machine learning (ML) systems. This textbook bridges the gap between
    theoretical foundations and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective
    required to build effective AI solutions. Unlike resources that focus primarily
    on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context
    in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware
    training, and inference acceleration. Readers will develop the ability to reason
    about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building
    flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.

- en: '**The Problem:** Students learn to train AI models, but few understand how
    to build the systems that actually make them work in production. When ML systems
    concepts are taught, students often learn individual components without grasping
    the holistic architecture—they can see the trees but miss the forest.'

    Harvard University, where students, faculty, and industry partners came together
    to explore the systems side of ML. The content was developed through real student
    contributions during Fall 2023\. What started as class notes has turned into a
    comprehensive educational resource we now share globally.'
