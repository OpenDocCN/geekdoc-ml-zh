- en: Equity grants can be understood as promises -- a company promises you a certain
    amount of equity if you stay with that company for a certain period of time. When
    that time is up and you receive your equity, that equity is said to have been
    vested.

- en: 'The more you stay at a company, the more equity you’ll get. Your new equity
    grants will also follow a vesting schedule. For example, you’re granted 100 shares
    when you join. After the first year, you have access to 25 shares. Because you’re
    performing well, you’re also awarded 80 extra shares over the next 4 years. So,
    at the end of your second year, you have: 25 old shares + 20 new shares = 45 shares.
    The longer you stay at a company, the more grants you have left to vest. The schedule
    is to incentivize employees to stay longer at a company.'
