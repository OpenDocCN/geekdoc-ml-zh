    if you call `.into_iter()` on a `Vec<Ticket>` you''ll get an iterator that returns

    calling `.into_iter()` on it. Quite often you want to iterate over a collection
    without consuming it, looking at **references** to the values instead. In the
    case of `Vec<Ticket>`, you''d want to iterate over `&Ticket` values.'
