<p>A <em>classifier</em> is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to identify an observation’s membership in one of two or more groups. In other words, the target variable in classification represents a <em>class</em> from a finite set rather than a continuous number. Examples include detecting spam emails or identifying hand-written digits.</p>
<p>This chapter and the next cover <em>discriminative</em> and <em>generative</em> classification, respectively. Discriminative classification directly models an observation’s class membership as a function of its input variables. Generative classification instead views the input variables as a function of the observation’s class. It first models the prior probability that an observation belongs to a given class, then calculates the probability of observing the observation’s input variables conditional on its class, and finally solves for the posterior probability of belonging to a given class using Bayes’ Rule. More on that in the following chapter.</p>
<p>The most common method in this chapter by far is logistic regression. This is not, however, the only discriminative classifier. This chapter also introduces two others: the <em>Perceptron Algorithm</em> and <em>Fisher’s Linear Discriminant</em>.</p>
