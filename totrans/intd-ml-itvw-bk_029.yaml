- en: '**Analytical thinking**, or the ability to solve problems effectively. This
    involves a step-by-step approach to break down complex problems into manageable
    components. You might not immediately know how to solve a problem, especially
    if it’s something you’ve never encountered before, but you should know how to
    systematically approach it. When hiring for junior roles, employers might value
    this skill more than anything else. You can teach someone Python in a few weeks,
    but it takes years to teach someone how to think.'

- en: '**Communication skills**. Real-world ML projects involve many different stakeholders
    from different backgrounds: ML engineers, DevOps engineers, subject matter experts
    (e.g. doctors, bankers, lawyers), product managers, business leaders. It’s important
    to communicate technical aspects of your ML models to people who are also involved
    in the developmental process but don’t necessarily have technical backgrounds.'

    have a brilliant idea but nobody understands it, it’s not brilliant. Keep in mind
    that there’s a huge difference between fundamentally complex ideas and ideas made
    complicated by the author’s inability to articulate them.

- en: '**Experience**. Whether you have completed similar tasks in the past and whether
    you can generalize from those experiences to future tasks. The tech industry is
    notorious for downplaying experience in favor of ready-to-burn-out twentysomethings.
    However, in ML where improvements are often made from empirical observations,
    experience makes all the difference between having a model that performs well
    on a benchmark dataset and making it work in real-time on real-world data. Experience
    is different from seniority. There are complacent engineers who’ve worked for
    decades with less experience than an inquisitive college student.'

- en: '**Leadership**. In this context, leadership means the ability to take initiative
    and complete tasks. If you’re assigned a task, will you be able to do it from
    start to finish without someone holding your hand? You don’t need to know how
    to do all components on your own, but you should know what help you need and be
    proactive in seeking it. This quality can be evaluated based on your past projects.
    In school or in your previous jobs, did you only do what you were told or did
    you seize opportunities and take initiative?'
