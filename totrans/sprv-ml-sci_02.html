<p>We wrote this book because we are passionate about science and machine learning, particularly their interaction.</p>
<!--
Timo's mathematical background, deepened by his study of the philosophy of science, complements Christoph's background from statistics to machine learning. Although our paths are similar, they differ in complementary ways: Timo takes a theoretical and philosophical approach, while Christoph focuses on the applied and methodological.
-->
<p>Our collaboration began during our Ph.D. studies, where we co-authored papers on interpretable machine learning. However, we soon realized that interpretability was but one piece of a puzzle. Exploring causality, uncertainty quantification, robustness, and other tools proved essential to convert ‘raw’ machine learning into a proper scientific tool. The deeper we dug, the clearer it became that an even bigger piece was missing: A strong justification for using machine learning in scientific modeling was needed. All our insights led us to this book.</p>
<p>Prepare for a journey through the philosophy of science, machine learning theory, pragmatic modeling advice, and short stories of our raven scientists.</p>
