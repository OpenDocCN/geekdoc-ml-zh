- en: The job search is a long, stressful, and occasionally demoralizing process.
    The timeline varies based on where you are and where you want to work. In the
    US, your job search should start three to six months before you want to start
    at your new job. For students, it may start at the beginning of your last year
    in school. If you’re required to give notice before leaving -- for example, in
    Germany, leaving employees must give a three-month notice -- this process should
    start much earlier. If you need a visa, you need to take into account the time
    it takes to obtain a visa.

    go over all those resources and build up your online presence. When going over
    an online course, make sure to do assignments on top of watching lectures. You
    can try to reimplement the papers that you find interesting, improve on them,
    and put them on GitHub. Try to enter at least a couple of Kaggle competitions.

- en: 'Three months before your interviews, you might have time to do two to three
    courses and read three books. For courses, I’d recommend one hands-on course like
    fast.ai’s *Practical Deep Learning for Coders* and one theoretical course like
    *Machine Learning* by Coursera. You might also want to check out my course at
    Stanford: *[Machine Learning Systems Design](http://cs329s.stanford.edu/)* since
    the course covers practical challenges and solutions for ML in production. For
    books, I’d recommend *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow et al., M*achine Learning:
    A Probabilistic Perspective* by Kevin P. Murphy.'

    Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)*, especially
    the parts about gradient descent, activations, and optimizations as well as rewatch
    *Full Stack Deep Learning* lectures, especially the ones on *Setting up Machine
    Learning Projects* and *Infrastructure and Tooling*. You might want to skim the
    questions in part 2 and part 3 of this book again. You should also review your
    previous projects in case your interviewers want to know all about them.'

    my mistake of staying up late cramming and showing up to my interviews half-asleep.
    Arrive 10 minutes before so you have time to settle in.

- en: You can't. Becoming an expert in anything takes years, if not decades. Stay
    clear of anyone who claims that they can give you a shortcut to becoming a machine
    learning expert. At best, they teach you bad machine learning. At worst, it's
    a scam.
