    by a recruiter first then passed onto the relevant hiring manager. If you’re referred,
    it might go to the hiring manager directly. For companies inundated with resumes,
    passing recruiter screening is very difficult.'

    non-coding questions too.

- en: Typically, there’s only one phone screen. However, in some cases, you might
    have two phone screens, either because the team isn’t convinced by your performance
    on the first, you’re being considered for another team, or it’s standard for that
    company to have two phone screens.

- en: '**Coding challenge**. Coding challenges are often given to new graduates and
    interns. Some teams have their challenge before their phone screen, but most have
    it after. “Challenge before screen” means they don’t want to talk to you before
    they know you can code. A challenge typically consists of 1-3 questions that you
    have between 30 mins and 3 hours to solve. You can prepare for it by practicing
    on sites like HackerRank or Leetcode. This step might be skipped for candidates
    with high-quality code online.'

- en: '**Offsite technical interviews**. Done remotely, these interviews might require
    coding. You should ask recruiters before each interview for its scope. If there’s
    coding involved, ask what platform will be used so you can familiarize yourself
    with it beforehand. With the rise of remote work, more and more traditional onsite
    technical interviews are becoming offsite.'

- en: '**Presentation**. This is often required for research scientist roles to evaluate
    your insights and for developer advocate roles for your communication skills.
    For research scientists, you have to present your own work, but for other roles,
    it may be about any technical topic. Some interviewers like this format as it
    allows them to not only see candidates in action but also learn something new.
    Make sure you discuss with your recruiter about acceptable topics so that you
    don’t violate Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with your current or previous employers.'

- en: '**Onsite interviews**. The last and most intimidating aspect of the hiring
    process can consist of anywhere between 4 and 8 (yes, 8) technical/whiteboard
    interviews which might include a lunch interview and/or social hangout with some
    team members. Your lunch host might or might not submit an evaluation. Traditionally,
    this is done onsite. However, with the rise of remote work, more and more teams
    are experimenting with remote onsites via conference calls.'

    like this. If they don’t, you can ask to get a sense of what your day will be
    like, and get the names of your interviewers.
