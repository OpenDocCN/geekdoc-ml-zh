<h1>Ticket ids</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/06_ticket_management/12_two_states.html">https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/06_ticket_management/12_two_states.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>Let's think again about our ticket management system.<br/>
Our ticket model right now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub struct Ticket {
    pub title: TicketTitle,
    pub description: TicketDescription,
    pub status: Status
}</code></pre>
<p>One thing is missing here: an <strong>identifier</strong> to uniquely identify a ticket.<br/>
That identifier should be unique for each ticket. That can be guaranteed by generating it automatically when
a new ticket is created.</p>
<h2 id="refining-the-model"><a class="header" href="#refining-the-model">Refining the model</a></h2>
<p>Where should the id be stored?<br/>
We could add a new field to the <code>Ticket</code> struct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub struct Ticket {
    pub id: TicketId,
    pub title: TicketTitle,
    pub description: TicketDescription,
    pub status: Status
}</code></pre>
<p>But we don't know the id before creating the ticket. So it can't be there from the get-go.<br/>
It'd have to be optional:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub struct Ticket {
    pub id: Option&lt;TicketId&gt;,
    pub title: TicketTitle,
    pub description: TicketDescription,
    pub status: Status
}</code></pre>
<p>That's also not ideal—we'd have to handle the <code>None</code> case every single time we retrieve a ticket from the store,
even though we know that the id should always be there once the ticket has been created.</p>
<p>The best solution is to have two different ticket <strong>states</strong>, represented by two separate types:
a <code>TicketDraft</code> and a <code>Ticket</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub struct TicketDraft {
    pub title: TicketTitle,
    pub description: TicketDescription
}

pub struct Ticket {
    pub id: TicketId,
    pub title: TicketTitle,
    pub description: TicketDescription,
    pub status: Status
}</code></pre>
<p>A <code>TicketDraft</code> is a ticket that hasn't been created yet. It doesn't have an id, and it doesn't have a status.<br/>
A <code>Ticket</code> is a ticket that has been created. It has an id and a status.<br/>
Since each field in <code>TicketDraft</code> and <code>Ticket</code> embeds its own constraints, we don't have to duplicate logic
across the two types.</p>
