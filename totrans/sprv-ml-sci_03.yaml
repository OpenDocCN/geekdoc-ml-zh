    Collider (LHC) deep below the French-Swiss border near Geneva to understand what
    our universe is ultimately made of. Each collision creates subatomic particles
    which often decay quickly, creating even more particles. Sensors surround the
    collision zone and record the passage of these particles, turning each collision
    event into data – a lot of data. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research,
    is the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. CERN’s data center processes
    up to a petabyte of data per day. That’s a million gigabytes. These amounts of
    data are far beyond anything a human can look at.

- en: 'To call the analysis of this data “challenging” is a complete understatement:
    It’s difficult to reconstruct the collisions because multiple collisions occur
    simultaneously; sensor data is generated faster than it can be written to disk;
    and some particles decay in less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.
    To make the data processing and analysis manageable, CERN researchers rely on
    machine learning. Machine learning systems scan the incoming event data and decide
    which to write to disk and which to ignore. Machine learning models also estimate
    the energy and timing of signals. Other machine learning models help reconstruct
    events and remove noise. Today, particle science at CERN is unthinkable without
    machine learning.'

    idea how to compress it into a scientific model. A peculiar bunch of neuro-stats-computer
    Ravens had recently developed a new modeling approach called supervised machine
    learning, which learns predictive models directly from data. But is this kind
    of modeling still science, or is it alchemy?

    are determined by their amino acid sequences. Proteins do a lot of heavy lifting
    in the body, from building muscles and repairing the body to breaking down food
    and sending messages. A protein’s structure is largely determined by its sequence
    of amino acids, the building blocks of protein. The protein’s structure, however,
    ultimately determines its function. The problem: It is difficult to predict how
    a protein will be structured if you only have the amino acid sequence. If scientists
    could do that reliably, it would help them with drug discovery, understanding
    disease mechanisms, and designing new proteins. Meet AlphaFold [[12]](references.html#ref-jumper2021highly),
