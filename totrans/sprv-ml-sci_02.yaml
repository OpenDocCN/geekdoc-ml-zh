- en: 'Our collaboration began during our Ph.D. studies, where we co-authored papers
    on interpretable machine learning. However, we soon realized that interpretability
    was but one piece of a puzzle. Exploring causality, uncertainty quantification,
    robustness, and other tools proved essential to convert ‘raw’ machine learning
    into a proper scientific tool. The deeper we dug, the clearer it became that an
    even bigger piece was missing: A strong justification for using machine learning
    in scientific modeling was needed. All our insights led us to this book.'
