- en: Companies might put junior and senior roles on different hiring processes. Junior
    candidates, who haven’t proved themselves through previous working experience,
    might have to go through more screenings. Amazon, for example, only requires coding
    challenges for junior candidates. Senior candidates, however, might be asked more
    difficult questions. For example, a few companies have told me that they only
    give the machine learning systems design questions^([21](#fn_21)) to more senior
    candidates since they don’t think junior candidates would have the context to
    do those questions well.

    for skills. When you hire junior engineers, you hire for attitude*.” I’ve heard
    this sentiment echo in multiple places.'

- en: A senior director at a public tech company told me that when he interviews junior
    candidates, including interns and recent college graduates, he cares more about
    how they think, how they respond, and how they adapt. A junior candidate with
    weaker technical skills but is willing to learn might be preferred over another
    junior candidate with stronger technical skills but a horrible attitude.
