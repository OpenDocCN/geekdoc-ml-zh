    examples of scientists using machine learning to gain insights? From there, we
    evaluated machine learning from the perspective of different scientific goals,
    such as prediction, control, explanation, and understanding. We argued that machine
    learning has great potential to become a mainstay of scientific problem-solving.
    However, bare-bones supervised machine learning does not do the trick – we need
    add-ons such as interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and the integration
    of causal knowledge, all of which we systematically introduced in dedicated chapters.
    One by one, we addressed how to “fix” the shortcomings of machine learning for
    science: Generalization, domain knowledge, interpretability, causality, robustness,
    uncertainty, reproducibility, and reporting.'

    machine learning. How will scientists integrate machine learning into their research?
    Will some sciences remain untouched by machine learning? What will be the role
    of future scientists in the face of machine learning automation?

    into her giant nest to talk about old times. Since then, several scientific problems
    have been solved, many with the help of machine learning. So, was it all good?
    Their smart feathers begin to vibrate. Rattle received a targeted ad from a radical
    political movement, and Krarah received a warning of an approaching storm. Krarah
    winked at Rattle: “No! Not all of it, but some of it for sure.”'

    and theoretical physics. Around the same time, in November 2022 to be exact, ChatGPT
    was released. One of many large language models that could be used as chatbots
    and for many natural language tasks. Today, these models can even integrate other
    inputs such as images. These so-called *foundation models* have a lot of potential
    and we can already see an impact on science:'

    automated. But that doesn’t mean we are moving toward a science without scientists.
    If you look at history, the job profile of scientists has always changed. In Aristotelian
    times, scientists were often collectors of knowledge, writing and reading were
    essential skills. Scientists like Copernicus or Galileo had to perform precise
    calculations using their brains instead of CPUs and a piece of paper instead of
    computer memory. Physicists in Einstein’s time couldn’t enter the field without
    strong training in pure mathematics. And in many fields of modern science, scientists
    without basic skills in programming and data analysis skills have a hard time.
    Similarly, the profile of future scientists will require basic machine learning
    modeling skills.

    up time for scientists to study new phenomena, which requires a different set
    of skills. That is, if writing grants and reviewing and submitting papers doesn’t
    eat up all the extra time – but that’s another story. Scientists are constantly
    reinventing their roles – discovering new things seems to be the only job description
    that never expires. In the end, science is what scientists find interesting, and
    for something to be interesting, there has to be a being with goals and desires
    who finds it interesting. In fact, we could start talking about artificial general
    intelligence and machine consciousness right now, but we prefer not to…

    scientific methodology it is today.

    make it difficult to keep track of the topics that are here to stay. Specific
    algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, convolutional neural
    networks, generative adversarial networks, graph neural networks, or transformer
    models always have a half-life. They may be state of the art for two to five years
    before the next competitor comes along.

    have to learn a new tool. But ideally, you also learn the principles that remain.
    Learning to program involves learning both general concepts like functions and
    the specific syntax of a programming language. The concepts often live for a long
    time: Someone who learned about functions 30 years ago still finds that knowledge
    relevant today, but they may no longer write their applications in Delphi or Pascal.'

    solutions.
