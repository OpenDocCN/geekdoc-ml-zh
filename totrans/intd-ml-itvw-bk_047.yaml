- en: Most interviewers you meet will be bad interviewers. Few companies have proper
    interview training programs. Junior interviewers lack the experience to know what
    signals to look for and lack the technical depth to evaluate your expertise. Senior
    interviewers might be set in their way with their list of pet questions and might
    defend to the death the merit of their techniques even in light of contradicting
    evidence.

- en: Bad interviewers ask bad questions. Even good interviewers sometimes ask bad
    questions. Here are some examples of bad interview questions.

    up**'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These questions reward those who happen to review this piece of knowledge before
    the interview or those who prioritize rote learning. Good candidates might be
    able to work out an equation eventually, but it’s probably not the best use of
    interview time. The knowledge that can be easily acquired isn’t worth testing
    for.

- en: Interviewers who ask these questions defend their decision by saying that it’s
    important for ML engineers to have good coding skills. This is based on the assumption
    that the ability to write linked lists signals coding ability, but it often only
    signals that a candidate has practiced for a standard software engineering interview.
    A better approach is to ask candidates to write solutions for practical tasks
    such as remove duplicated samples in a dataset that doesn’t fit in memory.

  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a candidate does poorly, you have no idea if it’s because they don’t understand
    PCA or because they don’t know how to talk to grandmas. A good interviewer would
    isolate the skills they want to evaluate. For example, interviewers can first
    give candidates a problem that can be solved with PCA (e.g. a dataset has a lot
    more features than samples). If candidates bring up PCA, interviewers ask them
    to explain PCA intuitively.

- en: 'Example: questions about “Moore–Penrose inverse” or “Frobenius norm.”'
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Candidates might know pseudoinverse or matrix norm without knowing that they
    are called Moore–Penrose and Frobenius. This can be especially hard for non-native
    English speakers who study in another language. If you encounter a term you’re
    not familiar with during interviews, ask for an example.

- en: '**Open-ended questions with one expected answer**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some interviewers ask open-ended questions that have multiple possible answers.
    However, because they know only one answer, they expect candidates to come up
    with that exact solution. This can be frustrating for candidates.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once these questions are solved, there isn’t much room for improvement. Answering
    them poorly means that a candidate is unqualified, but answering them well doesn’t
    mean that a candidate is good. These questions are okay during screening to make
    sure that a candidate can pass a bar, but bad for later interview rounds when
    you want to know how high a candidate can jump.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When asked a question that you think is bad, should you tell your interviewer
    that it’s bad? There’s a non-zero chance that your interviewer might appreciate
    your candid feedback, but statistically speaking, they might get offended and
    write you off as someone they wouldn’t want to work with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, you should ask for clarification. If stuck, explain why you’re stuck
    and what information you’d need to overcome it. If unsure about the interviewer’s
    intention, ask. “To better answer your question, is it to evaluate my understanding
    of X?” should be sufficient.
