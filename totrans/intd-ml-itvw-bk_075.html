<p><em>If some characters seem to be missing, it's because MathJax is not loaded correctly. Refreshing the page should fix it.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>[E] Why do we say that matrices are linear transformations?</li>
<li>[E] What’s the inverse of a matrix? Do all matrices have an inverse? Is the inverse of a matrix always unique?</li>
<li>[E] What does the determinant of a matrix represent?</li>
<li>[E] What happens to the determinant of a matrix if we multiply one of its rows by a scalar <script type="math/tex; ">t \times R</script>?</li>
<li>[M] A <script type="math/tex; ">4 \times 4</script> matrix has four eigenvalues <script type="math/tex; ">3, 3, 2, -1</script>. What can we say about the trace and the determinant of this matrix?</li>
<li><p>[M] Given the following matrix:<br/>
 <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; -2 \\
        -1 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 2 \\
        3 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; -6
    \end{bmatrix}
    </script></p>
<p> Without explicitly using the equation for calculating determinants, what can we say about this matrix’s determinant?</p>
<p> <strong>Hint</strong>: rely on a property of this matrix to determine its determinant.</p>
</li>
<li>[M] What’s the difference between the covariance matrix <script type="math/tex; ">A^TA</script> and the Gram matrix <script type="math/tex; ">AA^T</script>?</li>
<li><p>Given <script type="math/tex; ">A \in R^{n \times m}</script> and <script type="math/tex; ">b \in R^n</script></p>
<ol>
<li>[M] Find <script type="math/tex; ">x</script> such that: <script type="math/tex; ">Ax = b</script>.</li>
<li>[E] When does this have a unique solution?</li>
<li>[M] Why is it when A has more columns than rows, <script type="math/tex; ">Ax = b</script> has multiple solutions?</li>
<li>[M] Given a matrix A with no inverse. How would you solve the equation <script type="math/tex; ">Ax = b</script>? What is the pseudoinverse and how to calculate it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Derivative is the backbone of gradient descent.</p>
<ol>
<li>[E] What does derivative represent?</li>
<li>[M] What’s the difference between derivative, gradient, and Jacobian?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[H] Say we have the weights <script type="math/tex; ">w \in R^{d \times m}</script> and a mini-batch <script type="math/tex; ">x</script> of <script type="math/tex; ">n</script> elements, each element is of the shape <script type="math/tex; ">1 \times d</script> so that <script type="math/tex; ">x \in R^{n \times d}</script>. We have the output <script type="math/tex; ">y = f(x; w) = xw</script>. What’s the dimension of the Jacobian <script type="math/tex; ">\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}</script>?</li>
<li><p>[H] Given a very large symmetric matrix A that doesn’t fit in memory, say <script type="math/tex; ">A \in R^{1M \times 1M}</script> and a function <script type="math/tex; ">f</script> that can quickly compute <script type="math/tex; ">f(x) = Ax</script> for <script type="math/tex; ">x \in R^{1M}</script>. Find the unit vector <script type="math/tex; ">x</script> so that <script type="math/tex; ">x^TAx</script> is minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: Can you frame it as an optimization problem and use gradient descent to find an approximate solution?</p>
</li>
