    If hiring decisions followed a uniformly random distribution, the odds at major
    tech companies would be abysmal. Each year, [Google receives several million resumes
    and hires several thousand](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/17/heres-how-many-google-job-interviews-it-takes-to-hire-a-googler.html),
    which makes the odds around 0.2%.

  zh: 当申请一个职位时，你可能会想知道自己获得该职位的概率。如果招聘决策遵循均匀随机分布，那么在主要科技公司中的概率将是令人沮丧的。每年，[谷歌收到数百万份简历并雇佣数千人](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/17/heres-how-many-google-job-interviews-it-takes-to-hire-a-googler.html)，这使得概率大约为0.2%。
- en: However, the odds are not uniformly distributed for people applying for the
    same role at the same company. It depends on your profile, whether you’re referred
    and who referred you, how much the company needs that role, who screens your resume,
    who they already have in their pipeline, how serious other applicants are.

  zh: 然而，对于同一公司在同一职位上申请的人，概率并不是均匀分布的。这取决于你的个人资料，你是否被推荐以及推荐你的人，公司对该职位的需要程度，谁筛选你的简历，他们已经在其人才库中的人选，以及其他申请者的认真程度。

    candidate a phone screen whereas some only respond to the top applicants.

  zh: 公司的筛选哲学差异很大——一些公司会给每个明显没有资格的候选人进行电话筛选，而一些公司只对顶尖申请者做出回应。
- en: All of these factors, coupled with the fact that few companies publicize the
    number of resumes they receive or the number of hires each year, make it impossible
    to estimate the odds from submitting an application to getting an offer.

  zh: 所有这些因素，加上很少有公司公开他们每年收到的简历数量或招聘人数的事实，使得从提交申请到获得录用通知的概率估计变得不可能。
- en: However, it’s possible to estimate the onsite-to-offer ratio, the percentage
    of onsites that lead to offers, using the 15,897 interview reviews for software
    engineering related roles at 27 major tech companies on Glassdoor as of August
    2019\. This ratio correlates to the yield rate -- the percentage of candidates
    who accept their offers at a company. Even though the estimation is for software
    engineering roles, it serves as an indication for ML roles. There are many biases
    in this data, but hopefully, a large number of reviews smoothes out some noise^([49](#fn_49)).
    If all reviews suffer from the same biases, they are still useful for comparison
    across companies.

  zh: 然而，可以使用截至2019年8月Glassdoor上27家主要科技公司软件工程相关职位的15,897个面试评价来估计现场面试到录用通知的比例，即onsite-to-offer
    ratio，这是onsite导致录用的百分比。这个比例与录用率相关联——即接受公司录用通知的候选人百分比。尽管这个估计是针对软件工程职位的，但它可以作为机器学习职位的参考。这些数据中存在许多偏见，但希望大量的评价可以平滑掉一些噪声^([49](#fn_49))。即使所有评价都存在相同的偏见，它们对于公司间的比较仍然是有用的。
- en: The data shows that the onsite-to-offer ratio ranges from a low of 15% to a
    high of 70%, whereas the yield rate goes from 50% to 90%. For example, at Google,
    18.83% of onsites lead to offers, and 70% accept their offers.

- en: Due to the biases of online reviews, the actual numbers should be lower. After
    talking to recruiters and doing extensive research, I found that the onsite-to-offer
    ratios here are a few percentage points higher than the actual numbers. For example,

- en: The offer yield rate of near 90% is unheard of. Recruiters from companies with
    high yield rates told me that they aim to get those numbers up to 80%. The four
    companies leading the chart are NVIDIA, Adobe, SAP, and Salesforce. However, companies
    like Salesforce encourage candidates who accept their offers to leave reviews
    on Glassdoor, which inflates their actual yield rates.

- en: The 5 companies with the lowest onsite-to-offer ratios are all Internet giants
    -- Yelp, Google, Snap, Airbnb, and Facebook -- who are known to be highly selective.
    Companies with high onsite-to-offer ratios aren’t necessarily unselective. They
    might be more selective during the screening process and only interview candidates
    that they really like. Onsites are costly, so the higher the onsite-to-offer ratio,
    the more financially sound the process.

  zh: 现场面试到报价比率最低的5家公司都是互联网巨头——Yelp、Google、Snap、Airbnb和Facebook，它们以高度选择性而闻名。现场面试到报价比率高的公司不一定是不选择性的。他们可能在筛选过程中更加选择性强，只面试他们真正喜欢的候选人。现场面试成本高昂，因此现场面试到报价比率越高，过程越经济稳健。
- en: There’s a strong correlation (0.81) between the onsite-to-offer ratio and the
    yield rate -- the higher the onsite-to-offer ratio, the higher the yield rate.
    A candidate that gets an offer from Google is more likely to turn it down than
    a candidate that gets an offer from a less selective company.

  zh: 现场面试到报价比率和接受率之间有很强的相关性（0.81）——现场面试到报价比率越高，接受率越高。得到谷歌报价的候选人拒绝报价的可能性比得到不那么选择性公司报价的候选人要高。
- en: There are several reasons. First, if a candidate passes the interviews at selective
    companies like Google or Facebook, they probably have other attractive offers
    to choose from. Second, selective companies tend to make competitive offers, which
    incentivizes candidates to get offers from them to negotiate with companies that
    they really want to work for. Third, the process at those companies usually takes
    a long time. By the time a candidate receives the offer, they might have already
    settled at another company. Last but not least, since candidates at Google and
    Facebook only get matched with a team after they’ve received their offers, they
    might reject the offers if they don’t like the team.

  zh: 有几个原因。首先，如果一个候选人通过了像谷歌或Facebook这样的选择性公司的面试，他们可能还有其他吸引人的工作机会可供选择。其次，选择性公司往往会提供具有竞争力的报价，这激励候选人从他们那里获得报价，以便与真正想为之工作的公司进行谈判。第三，这些公司的流程通常需要很长时间。等到候选人收到报价时，他们可能已经在另一家公司安顿下来了。最后但同样重要的是，由于谷歌和Facebook的候选人只有在收到报价后才能与团队匹配，如果他们不喜欢团队，他们可能会拒绝报价。
