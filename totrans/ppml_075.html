<p>One of Rust's big promises is <em>fearless concurrency</em>: making it easier to write safe, concurrent programs.
We haven't seen much of that yet. All the work we've done so far has been single-threaded.
Time to change that!</p>
<p>In this chapter we'll make our ticket store multithreaded.<br/>
We'll have the opportunity to touch most of Rust's core concurrency features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threads, using the <code>std::thread</code> module</li>
<li>Message passing, using channels</li>
<li>Shared state, using <code>Arc</code>, <code>Mutex</code> and <code>RwLock</code></li>
<li><code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, the traits that encode Rust's concurrency guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss various design patterns for multithreaded systems and some of their trade-offs.</p>
