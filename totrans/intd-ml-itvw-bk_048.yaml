- en: You might want to avoid companies that have displayed the following red flags.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company is less interested in your expertise and more interested in whether
    you can fulfill their most urgent needs -- they might ask whether you can do this
    or that instead of digging deep into your knowledge and experience. If they only
    want you for their urgent needs, they might let you go when they’ve outgrown those
    needs.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company doesn’t respect your time, e.g. canceling your interviews last minute.
    Either they aren’t that interested in hiring you^([46](#fn_46)), or they are an
    organizational mess.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The majority of questions are bad. It means the company hasn’t spent a lot of
    time thinking about their hiring pipeline, which leads to poor hiring decisions,
    which in turn can ruin the company.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company pressures or threatens you into taking their offers. For example,
    they give you only a day to consider their offer^([47](#fn_47)). Companies should
    give you at least a week, and if you need more time to wait for interviewing results
    at other companies, they usually extend their deadline. Companies should hire
    only the people who want to join them after having considered all options, otherwise,
    they might keep wondering and leave at the first chance they get.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company displays a culture incompatible with your values. If you have small
    children, you might want to avoid companies that expect employees to respond to
    emails at 8pm. If you’re on the more mellow side, you might not want to join a
    company whose team building activities involve beer-pong or ax-throwing competitions.

    They did that to me and also to a friend of mine who eventually joined them. It
    could just be that they weren’t terribly excited about us joining.'

    ML researcher that if he doesn’t take his offer, he won’t be able to find jobs
    at any of the various organizations that this researcher is involved in.'
