- en: After NVIDIA, I wanted to join an early-stage startup. I was considering two
    AI startups that were similar on the surface. Both had just raised seed rounds.
    Both had about 10 employees, most of these were engineers, and were ready for
    hypergrowth.

  zh: 在加入NVIDIA之后，我想加入一家早期阶段的创业公司。我正在考虑两家表面上相似的AI创业公司。两家公司都刚刚完成了种子轮融资。两家公司都有大约10名员工，其中大多数是工程师，并准备进行高速增长。
- en: Startup A already had three customers, had just hired its first salesperson,
    and was ready to hire more salespeople to aggressively sell. Startup B had two
    customers, who they called design partners, and had no plan yet of hiring salespeople.
    I liked the work at startup B more but thought that startup A had a better sales
    prospect than startup B, and for early-stage startups, sales are essential for
    survival.

  zh: 创业公司A已经有了三个客户，刚刚雇佣了第一位销售员，并准备雇佣更多销售员以积极销售。创业公司B有两个客户，他们称之为设计合作伙伴，还没有计划雇佣销售员。我更喜欢创业公司B的工作，但认为创业公司A的销售前景比创业公司B更好，而对于早期阶段的创业公司来说，销售对于生存至关重要。
- en: 'When I told this dilemma to a friend, who had invested in companies similar
    to both A and B, he pointed out to me that I forgot to consider the key difference
    between these two startups: A was an applications company while B was a tooling
    company.'

  zh: 当我把这个困境告诉一个投资了与A和B类似公司的朋友时，他指出了我忘记考虑这两个创业公司之间的关键区别：A是一家应用公司，而B是一家工具公司。
- en: Applications companies provide applications to solve a specific business problem
    such as business analytics or fraud detection. Tooling companies create tools
    to help companies build their own applications. Examples of tools are TensorFlow,
    Sparks, Airflow, Kubernetes.

- en: Applications are likely made to be used by subject matter experts who don’t
    want to be cumbered with engineering aspects (e.g. bankers who want applications
    for fraud detection or customer representatives who want applications to classify
    customer tickets). Tools are likely made to be used by developers. Some are explicitly
    known as devtools.

  zh: 应用程序可能是由不想被工程方面所累的领域专家使用的（例如，想要欺诈检测应用程序的银行家或想要对客户票据进行分类的应用程序的客户代表）。工具可能是由开发者使用的。其中一些明确被称为开发工具。
- en: In the beginning, it’s easier to sell an application because it’s easier to
    see the immediate impact of an application and there’s less overhead for adopting
    an application. For example, you can tell a company that you can detect fraudulent
    transactions with 10% higher accuracy and the company can just input their data
    into your application and get out results whether a transaction is fraudulent
    or not.

  zh: 在一开始，销售应用程序更容易，因为更容易看到应用程序的即时影响，并且采用应用程序的 overhead 较少。例如，你可以告诉一家公司，你可以以10%更高的准确率检测欺诈交易，该公司只需将他们的数据输入到你的应用程序中，就可以得到结果，知道一笔交易是否欺诈。
- en: For a company to adopt a tool, there’s a lot of engineering overhead. They might
    have to swap out their existing tool, integrate the new tool with the rest of
    their infrastructure, retrain their staff or replace their staff. Many companies
    want to wait until a tool proves its usefulness and stability to a large number
    of companies first before adopting it.

  zh: 对于一个公司来说，采用一个工具需要大量的工程 overhead。他们可能需要更换现有的工具，将新工具与他们的基础设施集成，重新培训员工或更换员工。许多公司希望在工具证明其对大量公司的有用性和稳定性之后才采用它。
- en: However, for tooling companies, selling becomes a lot easier later on. Once
    your tool has reached a critical mass with a sufficient number of engineers who
    are proficient in it and prefer it, other companies might just become a user without
    you having to sell it. However, it’s really, really hard to get to that critical
    mass for new tools, and therefore, in general, tooling companies have higher risks
    than applications.

  zh: 然而，对于工具公司来说，销售在后期会容易得多。一旦你的工具已经拥有足够多的熟练使用并偏好它的工程师，其他公司可能就会成为用户，而无需你进行销售。然而，对于新工具来说，达到这个临界质量是非常困难的，因此，总的来说，工具公司的风险比应用程序公司要高。
- en: After talking to my friend, I realized that it’s normal for a company like A
    to have more customers than a company like B early on. But it doesn’t mean that
    A has a better sales prospect. In fact, having two large companies as design partners
    is a really good sign for B.

  zh: 和我的朋友交谈后，我意识到对于像A这样的公司来说，在早期拥有比像B这样的公司更多的客户是正常的。但这并不意味着A有更好的销售前景。事实上，有两个大型公司作为设计合作伙伴对B来说是一个非常好的迹象。
- en: A year later, both companies acquired a similar number of customers and grew
    to have around 30 employees, but more than half of company A are in sales whereas
    80% of company B are in engineering.

  zh: 一年后，两家公司都获得了相似数量的客户，并增长到大约30名员工，但公司A超过一半的人都在销售部门，而公司B的80%的人都在工程部门。
- en: This new understanding helped me narrow down my choices. Because I preferred
    building tools for developers and wanted to work for an engineering-first instead
    of a sales-first organization, the decision became much easier.

  zh: 这种新的理解帮助我缩小了选择范围。因为我更喜欢为开发者构建工具，并希望在一个以工程为先而不是以销售为先的组织中工作，所以这个决定变得容易多了。

  zh: ⚠ 不确定性 ⚠
- en: Whether a company is an application company or a tooling company might just
    be a go-to-market strategy. For example, you have a new tool that can address
    use cases that companies aren’t aware of yet, and you know it’d be hard to convince
    companies to make significant changes to their existing infrastructures for uncertain
    use cases. So you come up with a compelling use case that can’t be done without
    your tool, build an application around that use case, and sell that application
    instead. Once customers are aware of the usefulness of your tool, you switch to
    selling the tool directly.

  zh: 一家公司是应用程序公司还是工具公司可能只是进入市场的策略。例如，你有一个新的工具可以解决公司尚未意识到的用例，你知道要说服公司为不确定的用例对现有基础设施进行重大改变是很困难的。所以你提出了一个没有你的工具就无法完成的令人信服的用例，围绕这个用例构建一个应用程序，然后销售这个应用程序。一旦客户意识到你的工具的有用性，你就转向直接销售工具。
