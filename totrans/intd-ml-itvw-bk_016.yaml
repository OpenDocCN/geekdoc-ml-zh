    and incremental development**. It means that you can’t really be done with a step,
    move to the next, and never come back to it again. There’s a lot of back and forth
    among various steps.

    gives you an idea of what work needs to be done to bring a model to the real world
    and the possible roles available. Second, it helps you avoid ML projects that
    are bound to fail when the organizations behind them don’t set them up in a way
    that allows iterative development and cross-functional communication.
