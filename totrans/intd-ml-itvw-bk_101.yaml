- en: Candidates are frustrated with the hiring process -- it's beyond their control.
    But hiring managers also seem frustrated with their own processes because they
    can’t or don’t know how to change them. Every hiring manager I’ve talked to expressed
    interest in reading this book to learn from other companies. I don't hope to change
    a system with one book. I just hope it provides a scaffold on which we can start
    the conversation and establish good interviewing practices.

- en: Hiring for ML roles is competitive. Strong candidates always have options, but
    strong candidates in ML have a lot more options. A hiring process with the candidates’
    experience in mind will give candidates a better impression of your company, making
    them more likely to accept your offer. A better process can help you attract more
    suitable candidates, make better hires, which saves you time down the line. Even
    if it’s a no-hire, you still want to win their allegiance. You might want to reinterview
    them in the future, they might recommend you to their network, and they can become
    advocates for your products.

- en: 'ML interviews are still a black box. For a field so obsessed with qualitative
    methodologies, it’s surprising that there has been so little qualitative research
    done on the hiring process for ML roles. Few companies can state with any certainty
    the correlation between their interview techniques and the quality of hires. Some
    of the challenges include:'

    their job performances to the performances of those who pass.

- en: A low hanging fruit is testing your pipeline on existing people within your
    organization. See how they like the process and whether their performances on
    the interviews correlate with their performances on the jobs. Another is actively
    soliciting feedback from candidates. Instead of sending out survey links that
    nobody clicks on, after each onsite, have someone not involved in the hiring process
    spend 15 minutes talking to the candidate. Make sure the candidate knows that
    their feedback won’t affect the hiring decision in any way.

- en: If you don’t have a training program for interviewers already, please set up
    one. Interviewers are both gatekeepers and faces of your organization. Letting
    new hires shadow for a few interviews isn’t enough. New hires have no idea what
    they are doing, and companies have no way of standardizing feedback across teams,
    interviewers, and candidates.
