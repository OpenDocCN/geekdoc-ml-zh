- en: In this first part of the book, we look at machine learning from a philosophical
    angle. How can machine learning help to advance science? After all, isn’t machine
    learning only a tool for making better predictions?

- en: In this part, we discuss, on the one hand, the importance that predictions take
    in science and justify machine learning based on its predictive powers. On the
    other hand, we emphasize the importance of other scientific goals like enabling
    control, explanations, and reasoning, and describe how they clash with the hyperfocus
    of current machine learning on prediction. We finish this part by highlighting
    several concrete limitations of bare-bones machine learning. To learn how to tackle
    these limitations, you should check out Part II of the book.
