<p>Welcome to <strong>"100 Exercises To Learn Rust"</strong>!</p>
<p>This course will teach you Rust's core concepts, one exercise at a time.<br/>
You'll learn about Rust's syntax, its type system, its standard library, and its ecosystem.</p>
<p>We don't assume any prior knowledge of Rust, but we assume you know at least
another programming language.
We also don't assume any prior knowledge of systems programming or memory management. Those
topics will be covered in the course.</p>
<p>In other words, we'll be starting from scratch!<br/>
You'll build up your Rust knowledge in small, manageable steps.
By the end of the course, you will have solved ~100 exercises, enough to
feel comfortable working on small to medium-sized Rust projects.</p>
<h2 id="methodology"><a class="header" href="#methodology">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>This course is based on the "learn by doing" principle.<br/>
It has been designed to be interactive and hands-on.</p>
<p><a href="https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/">Mainmatter</a> developed this course
to be delivered in a classroom setting, over 4 days: each attendee advances
through the lessons at their own pace, with an experienced instructor providing
guidance, answering questions and diving deeper into the topics as needed.<br/>
You can sign up for the next tutored session on <a href="https://ti.to/mainmatter/rust-from-scratch-jan-2025">our website</a>.
If you'd like to organise a private session for your company, please <a href="https://mainmatter.com/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>You can also take the courses on your own, but we recommend you find a friend or
a mentor to help you along the way should you get stuck. You can
find solutions for all exercises in the
<a href="https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust/tree/solutions"><code>solutions</code> branch of the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="formats"><a class="header" href="#formats">Formats</a></h2>
<p>You can go through the course material <a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/">in the browser</a> or <a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.pdf">download it as a PDF file</a>, for offline reading.<br/>
If you prefer to have the course material printed out, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJ14KQQG/">buy a paperback copy on Amazon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="structure"><a class="header" href="#structure">Structure</a></h2>
<p>On the left side of the screen, you can see that the course is divided into sections.
Each section introduces a new concept or feature of the Rust language.<br/>
To verify your understanding, each section is paired with an exercise that you need to solve.</p>
<p>You can find the exercises in the
<a href="https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust">companion GitHub repository</a>.<br/>
Before starting the course, make sure to clone the repository to your local machine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># If you have an SSH key set up with GitHub
git clone git@github.com:mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.git
# Otherwise, use the HTTPS URL:
#   https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.git
</code></pre>
<p>We also recommend you work on a branch, so you can easily track your progress and pull
in updates from the main repository, if needed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd 100-exercises-to-learn-rust
git checkout -b my-solutions
</code></pre>
<p>All exercises are located in the <code>exercises</code> folder.
Each exercise is structured as a Rust package.
The package contains the exercise itself, instructions on what to do (in <code>src/lib.rs</code>), and a test suite to
automatically verify your solution.</p>
<h3 id="tools"><a class="header" href="#tools">Tools</a></h3>
<p>To work through this course, you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install"><strong>Rust</strong></a>.
If <code>rustup</code> is already installed on your system, run <code>rustup update</code> (or another appropriate command depending on how you installed Rust on your system) to ensure you're running on the latest stable version.</li>
<li><em>(Optional but recommended)</em> An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
We recommend one of the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/">RustRover</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workshop-runner-wr"><a class="header" href="#workshop-runner-wr">Workshop runner, <code>wr</code></a></h3>
<p>To verify your solutions, we've also provided a tool to guide you through the course: the <code>wr</code> CLI, short for "workshop runner".
Install <code>wr</code> by following the instructions on <a href="https://mainmatter.github.io/rust-workshop-runner/">its website</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have <code>wr</code> installed, open a new terminal and navigate to the top-level folder of the repository.
Run the <code>wr</code> command to start the course:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wr
</code></pre>
<p><code>wr</code> will verify the solution to the current exercise.<br/>
Don't move on to the next section until you've solved the exercise for the current one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend committing your solutions to Git as you progress through the course,
so you can easily track your progress and "restart" from a known point if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy the course!</p>
