- en: Rust offers a wide range of tools to help you represent the constraints of your
    domain directly in the type system, but it takes some practice to get it right
    and write code that looks idiomatic.

- en: We'll introduce a new type for each of the fields in `Ticket` to encapsulate
    the respective constraints.

- en: 'Every time someone accesses a `Ticket` field, they''ll get back a value that''s
    guaranteed to be valid—i.e. a `TicketTitle` instead of a `String`. They won''t
    have to worry about the title being empty elsewhere in the code: as long as they
    have a `TicketTitle`, they know it''s valid **by construction**.'

    safer and more expressive.
