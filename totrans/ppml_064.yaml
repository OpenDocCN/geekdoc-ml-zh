    for `&TicketStore`, for maximum convenience in `for` loops.

    type returned by `Vec::iter()`.

- en: Lifetimes are **labels** used by the Rust compiler to keep track of how long
    a reference (either mutable or immutable) is valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lifetime of a reference is constrained by the scope of the value it refers
    to. Rust always makes sure, at compile-time, that references are not used after
    the value they refer to has been dropped, to avoid dangling pointers and use-after-free
    bugs.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`''a` is used to **tie together** the lifetime of the `Vec` and the lifetime
    of the `Iter` returned by `iter()`. In plain English: the `Iter` returned by `iter()`
    cannot outlive the `Vec` reference (`&self`) it was created from.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is important because `Vec::iter`, as we discussed, returns an iterator
    over **references** to the `Vec`'s elements. If the `Vec` is dropped, the references
    returned by the iterator would be invalid. Rust must make sure this doesn't happen,
    and lifetimes are the tool it uses to enforce this rule.

- en: 'Rust has a set of rules, called **lifetime elision rules**, that allow you
    to omit explicit lifetime annotations in many cases. For example, `Vec::iter`''s
    definition looks like this in `std`''s source code:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE3]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: No explicit lifetime parameter is present in the signature of `Vec::iter()`.
    Elision rules imply that the lifetime of the `Iter` returned by `iter()` is tied
    to the lifetime of the `&self` reference. You can think of `'_` as a **placeholder**
    for the lifetime of the `&self` reference.
