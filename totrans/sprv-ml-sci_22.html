<p>Writing this book was super fun. But it was a lot of work and we are very thankful for all the support we received.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the beta readers for their valuable feedback on our drafts: Diabb Zegpi Delgado, Gunnar König, Heidi Seibold, Ida Ahmad, Martine Jansen, Susanne Dandl, Thomas Freiesleben, Thomas Grote, Tom Sterkenburg, and Zelimir Kurtanjek.</p>
<p>Raven images for the cover and for the raven stories were created by <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/jeeshiu">jeeshiu from Fiverr</a>.</p>
<p>Timo’s postdoc position is funded by the Carl Zeiss Foundation project “Certification and Foundations of Safe Machine Learning Systems in Healthcare”.</p>
