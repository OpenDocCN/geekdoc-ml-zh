    **accelerometers** and **Gyroscopes**). These time-series type datasets should
    be preprocessed before inputting them into a Machine Learning model training,
    which is a challenging area for embedded machine learning. Still, Edge Impulse
    helps overcome this complexity with its digital signal processing (DSP) preprocessing
    step and, more specifically, the [Spectral Features Block](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-studio/processing-blocks/spectral-features)

- en: 'Extracting features from a dataset captured with inertial sensors, such as
    accelerometers, involves processing and analyzing the raw data. Accelerometers
    measure the acceleration of an object along one or more axes (typically three,
    denoted as X, Y, and Z). These measurements can be used to understand various
    aspects of the object’s motion, such as movement patterns and vibrations. Here’s
    a high-level overview of the process:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data collection**: First, we need to gather data from the accelerometers.
    Depending on the application, data may be collected at different sampling rates.
    It’s essential to ensure that the sampling rate is high enough to capture the
    relevant dynamics of the studied motion (the sampling rate should be at least
    double the maximum relevant frequency present in the signal).'

    or irrelevant information. Preprocessing steps, such as filtering and normalization,
    can help clean and standardize the data, making it more suitable for feature extraction.'

    when working with Sensor Fusion, it could be necessary to perform this step before
    uploading data to the Studio. This is particularly crucial in sensor fusion projects,

    extraction more manageable and meaningful. The **window size** and overlap (**window

    and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The Studio can help with such feature-relevant

- en: Wavelet transforms work by breaking down a signal into different frequency components
    and analyzing them individually. The transformation is achieved by convolving
    the signal with a **wavelet function**, a small waveform centered at a specific
    time and frequency. This process effectively decomposes the signal into different
    frequency bands, each of which can be analyzed separately.

- en: One of the critical benefits of wavelet transforms is that they allow for time-frequency
    analysis, which means that they can reveal the frequency content of a signal as
    it changes over time. This makes them particularly useful for analyzing non-stationary
    signals, which vary over time.

    measures a signal’s uncertainty or randomness. It is calculated as the negative
    sum of the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of the signal multiplied
    by their base 2 logarithm. In the context of wavelet analysis, Shannon entropy
    can be used to measure the complexity of the signal, with higher values indicating
    greater complexity.
