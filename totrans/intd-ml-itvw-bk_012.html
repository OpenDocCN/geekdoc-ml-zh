<p>As the research community takes the “bigger, better” approach, new models often require a massive amount of data and tens of millions of dollars in computing. The estimated market cost to train DeepMind’s AlphaStar and OpenAI’s GPT-3 is in the tens of millions each<sup><a href="#fn_4" id="reffn_4">4</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="reffn_5">5</a></sup>.  Most companies and academic institutions can’t afford to pursue pure research.</p>
<p>Outside academic institutions, there are only a handful of machine learning research labs in the world. Most of these labs are funded by corporations with deep pockets such as Alphabet (Google Brain, DeepMind), Microsoft, Facebook, Tencent<sup><a href="#fn_6" id="reffn_6">6</a></sup>. You can find these labs by browsing the affiliations of published papers at major academic conferences including <a href="https://www.guide2research.com/topconf/machine-learning" target="_blank">NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ACL</a>. In 2019 and 2020, Alphabet accounts for over 10% of all papers at NeurIPS[<a href="https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1170174478304759809/photo/1" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/neurips-2020-comprehensive-analysis-of-authors-organizations-and-countries-a1b55a08132e" target="_blank">2</a>].</p>

<p>🌳 <strong>Tip</strong> 🌳<br/>
Not all these industry labs publish papers -- companies like Apple and Tesla are notoriously secretive. Even if an industry lab publishes, it might only publish a portion of its research. Before joining an industry lab, you might want to consider its publishing policy. Joining a secretive lab might mean that you won’t be able to explain to other people what you’ve been working on or what you’re capable of doing.</p>

     In an earlier draft of this book, I included Uber AI and Element AI. However, <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/uber-ai-labs-layoffs/" target="_blank">Uber AI research lab was laid off in April 2020</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1341075433173860352" target="_blank">Element AI was sold for cheap in November 2020</a>.</p>
