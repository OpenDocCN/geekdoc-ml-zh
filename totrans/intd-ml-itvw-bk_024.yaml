- en: This is a question that I often hear from people early in their careers, and
    a question that can prompt heated discussions. I’ve worked at both big companies
    and startups, and my impressions were pretty much aligned with what is often said
    of the trade-off between big company stability and startup high impact (and high
    risk).

- en: Statistically speaking, software engineers are more likely to work for a big
    company than a small startup. Even though there are more small companies than
    large corporations, large corporations employ more people. According to [StackOver
    Developer Survey 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#company-type),
    more than half of the 71K respondents worked for a company of at least 100 employees.

    means that an average MLE most likely works for a company of at least 100 employees.
