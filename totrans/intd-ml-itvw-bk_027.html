<p>The goal of the interviewing process is for a company to assess:</p>
<ol>
<li>whether you have the necessary skills and knowledge to do the job</li>
<li>whether they can provide you with a suitable environment to carry out that task.</li>
</ol>
<p>Companies will be looking at both your technical and non-technical skills.</p>
