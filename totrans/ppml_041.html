<p>We've covered quite a few different traits in this chapter—and we've only scratched the surface!
It may feel like you have a lot to remember, but don't worry: you'll bump into these traits
so often when writing Rust code that they'll soon become second nature.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts"><a class="header" href="#closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</a></h2>
<p>Traits are powerful, but don't overuse them.<br/>
A few guidelines to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't make a function generic if it is always invoked with a single type. It introduces indirection in your
codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain.</li>
<li>Don't create a trait if you only have one implementation. It's a sign that the trait is not needed.</li>
<li>Implement standard traits for your types (<code>Debug</code>, <code>PartialEq</code>, etc.) whenever it makes sense.
It will make your types more idiomatic and easier to work with, unlocking a lot of functionality provided
by the standard library and ecosystem crates.</li>
<li>Implement traits from third-party crates if you need the functionality they unlock within their ecosystem.</li>
<li>Beware of making code generic solely to use mocks in your tests. The maintainability cost of this approach
can be high, and it's often better to use a different testing strategy. Check out the
<a href="https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop">testing masterclass</a>
for details on high-fidelity testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before moving on, let's go through one last exercise to consolidate what we've learned.
You'll have minimal guidance this time—just the exercise description and the tests to guide you.</p>
