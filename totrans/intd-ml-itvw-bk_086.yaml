- en: Even though deep learning seems to be all that people in the research community
    is talking about, most real-world problems are still being solved by classical
    machine learning algorithms including k-nearest neighbor and XGBoost. In this
    chapter, we will cover fundamentals that are essential for understanding machine
    learning algorithms, as well as non-deep learning algorithms that you might find
    useful in both your day-to-day jobs and interviews.
