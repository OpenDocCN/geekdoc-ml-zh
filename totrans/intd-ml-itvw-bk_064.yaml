    August 2019, so some of the links might have become outdated, but the curriculum
    can still be useful to have a sense of what areas of knowledge you should acquire
    and find other ways to acquire them, e.g. other courses or books^([51](#fn_51)).

    theories with practices. The lecture notes are well written with visualizations
    and examples that explain difficult concepts such as backpropagation, gradient
    descent, losses, regularizations, dropouts, batchnorm, etc.

    Christopher Manning, this is a must-take course for anyone interested in NLP.
    The course is well organized, well taught, and up-to-date with the latest NLP
    research. The assignments, while useful, can sometimes be frustrating as training
    NLP models takes time.

    ML course. As of writing, its Coursera version has been enrolled by more 2.5M
    people. This course is theoretical, so students would benefit more from it after
    more practical courses such as CS231N, CS224N, and Practical Deep Learning for
    Coders.

    on top of another, this specialization tackles AI top down as it asks you to think
    about the relationships between different variables, how you represent those relationships,
    what independence you’re assuming, what exactly you’re trying to learn when you
    say machine learning. This specialization isn’t easy, but it’ll change the way
    you approach ML. You can also consult detailed notes written by Stanford CS228’s
    TAs [here](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/).

    Z. This is also a great resource for those struggling with the machine learning
    system design questions in interviews.
