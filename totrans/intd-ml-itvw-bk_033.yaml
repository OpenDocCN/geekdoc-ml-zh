    Out of all possible channels for sourcing candidates, referrals are, by far, the
    best channel. Recruiters have, for a long time, unanimously agreed on the effectiveness

    Microsoft and Oracle have more than half of their interviewees recruited through
    campus events such as career fairs and tech talks. Internet giants like Google,
    Facebook, and Airbnb rely less on campus recruiting, but it still accounts for
    between 20 and 30% of their onsites. Big tech companies concentrate their recruiting
    efforts on a handful of popular engineering schools: Stanford, UC Berkeley, MIT,
    Caltech, CMU, University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo. The students
    recruited from those schools then refer their classmates. The circle goes on,
    turning those major tech companies into a Tech Ivy alumni mixer.'

- en: From the employers’ perspective, targeting their most promising sources can
    reduce the hiring cost as well as the risk of disastrous hires. It is, therefore,
    not surprising that the default message to most candidates who submit their resumes
    through less promising sources like online applications is “Thank you, next.”
    This process is far from ideal as it creates an exclusive, anti-meritocratic environment.
    Many qualified people are rejected simply because they don’t go to the right school
    or don’t have the right network.

    for is that you have a set of skills and/or portfolio that attract recruiters.
    Around 15 to 25% of onsite candidates for junior roles at each company are contacted
    by recruiters. For senior roles, this number doubles.

    that are the friendliest to online applicants are Twitter, Amazon, and Airbnb
    with roughly half of their onsite candidates being online applicants. Companies
    among the most likely to pass on hopeful online applicants are Facebook, Microsoft,
    and Oracle.
