<h1>2.3.1.3 Communication</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/contents/2.3.1.3-communication.html">https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/contents/2.3.1.3-communication.html</a></blockquote>
                                
                                
<p>Communication is arguably the most important soft skill for a job. Teamwork is impossible if team members don’t or can’t communicate with each other. Each company will want to evaluate not only how well you communicate but also whether you can adapt to the communication style of the company. For example, if a company is heavy on daily status updates and you prefer to disappear for days to focus on a project and only emerge when you’re done, it might not be a good fit.</p>
<p>Your communication style and skills are evaluated through the entire process, from your cover letter, how you respond to their emails, to the way you answer each interview question. Companies might also ask explicit questions about how you communicate. Here are some of the questions to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about a time you had to give constructive criticism.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time you received critical feedback.</li>
<li>Have you ever disagreed with your manager? How did you address that?</li>
<li>How would your coworkers describe your communication style?</li>
<li>What was the most ambiguous project you’ve been part of? How did you handle it?</li>
<li>What kind of managerial style would bring out the best in you?</li>
</ul>
