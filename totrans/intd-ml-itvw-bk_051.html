<p>Life doesn’t end after a rejection. It doesn’t end after getting an offer either. You might want to negotiate your offer, consider other opportunities, contemplate your career perspective at the company or after you leave.</p>
<p>It seems silly to think about leaving a company before joining, but at 13.2%, the tech industry has the highest turnover rate out of all business sections. Median tenure at Amazon is one year, and Google 1.1 years<sup><a href="#fn_50" id="reffn_50">50</a></sup>. You might find yourself being a candidate again sooner than you would think.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss compensation details and career progression that might be useful when you consider your options.</p>
