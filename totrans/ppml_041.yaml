    scratched the surface! It may feel like you have a lot to remember, but don''t
    worry: you''ll bump into these traits so often when writing Rust code that they''ll
    soon become second nature.'

- en: Don't make a function generic if it is always invoked with a single type. It
    introduces indirection in your codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain.

- en: Don't create a trait if you only have one implementation. It's a sign that the
    trait is not needed.

- en: Implement standard traits for your types (`Debug`, `PartialEq`, etc.) whenever
    it makes sense. It will make your types more idiomatic and easier to work with,
    unlocking a lot of functionality provided by the standard library and ecosystem
    crates.

    unlock within their ecosystem.

- en: Beware of making code generic solely to use mocks in your tests. The maintainability
    cost of this approach can be high, and it's often better to use a different testing
    strategy. Check out the [testing masterclass](https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop)
    for details on high-fidelity testing.
