<h1>Scoped threads</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/07_threads/04_scoped_threads.html">https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/07_threads/04_scoped_threads.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>All the lifetime issues we discussed so far have a common source:
the spawned thread can outlive its parent.<br/>
We can sidestep this issue by using <strong>scoped threads</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let midpoint = v.len() / 2;

std::thread::scope(|scope| {
    scope.spawn(|| {
        let first = &amp;v[..midpoint];
        println!("Here's the first half of v: {first:?}");
    });
    scope.spawn(|| {
        let second = &amp;v[midpoint..];
        println!("Here's the second half of v: {second:?}");
    });
});

println!("Here's v: {v:?}");</code></pre>
<p>Let's unpack what's happening.</p>
<h2 id="scope"><a class="header" href="#scope"><code>scope</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>std::thread::scope</code> function creates a new <strong>scope</strong>.<br/>
<code>std::thread::scope</code> takes a closure as input, with a single argument: a <code>Scope</code> instance.</p>
<h2 id="scoped-spawns"><a class="header" href="#scoped-spawns">Scoped spawns</a></h2>
<p><code>Scope</code> exposes a <code>spawn</code> method.<br/>
Unlike <code>std::thread::spawn</code>, all threads spawned using a <code>Scope</code> will be
<strong>automatically joined</strong> when the scope ends.</p>
<p>If we were to "translate" the previous example to <code>std::thread::spawn</code>,
it'd look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let midpoint = v.len() / 2;

let handle1 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
    let first = &amp;v[..midpoint];
    println!("Here's the first half of v: {first:?}");
});
let handle2 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
    let second = &amp;v[midpoint..];
    println!("Here's the second half of v: {second:?}");
});

handle1.join().unwrap();
handle2.join().unwrap();

println!("Here's v: {v:?}");</code></pre>
<h2 id="borrowing-from-the-environment"><a class="header" href="#borrowing-from-the-environment">Borrowing from the environment</a></h2>
<p>The translated example wouldn't compile, though: the compiler would complain
that <code>&amp;v</code> can't be used from our spawned threads since its lifetime isn't
<code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>That's not an issue with <code>std::thread::scope</code>—you can <strong>safely borrow from the environment</strong>.</p>
<p>In our example, <code>v</code> is created before the spawning points.
It will only be dropped <em>after</em> <code>scope</code> returns. At the same time,
all threads spawned inside <code>scope</code> are guaranteed to finish <em>before</em> <code>scope</code> returns,
therefore there is no risk of having dangling references.</p>
<p>The compiler won't complain!</p>
