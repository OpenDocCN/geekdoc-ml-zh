- en: It’s typically much easier to interview for an internship and then get a return
    offer as a full-time employee than to interview for a full-time position directly.
    The interview process is a proxy to predict how well you will perform on the job.
    If you’ve already interned with a team, they know your ability and fit, and therefore
    might prefer you to an unknown candidate.

    source for full-time talent. An average intern at Facebook makes $8,000/month,
    almost twice as much as an average American full-time worker^([43](#fn_43)), and
    Facebook isn’t even the highest bidder^([44](#fn_44)). It’s hard to justify this
    salary unless it can offset the recruiting cost later.

- en: The interview process for interns is less complicated because an internship
    is less of a commitment. If a company doesn’t like an intern, that intern will
    be gone in three months. But if they don’t like a full-time employee, firing that
    person is expensive. The number of full-time positions is subjected to a strict
    headcount, but the number of interns often isn’t. Even when a company freezes
    the hiring process, such as to cut costs, they might still hire interns.

    likely get an intern-to-full-time offer. At NVIDIA, the majority of full-time
    offers for new graduates go to their interns. Rachelle Gupta, an ex-recruiter
    for Google and GitHub, wrote in one of her answers on Quora that:'

    be as high as the low 90’s% at top tech companies. I am defining conversion to
    mean ‘eligible to convert to full time employment’ and not just eligible for an
    internship next year. At Google, when a team gets an internship it comes with
    a full-time role that the intern can convert to*.^([45](#fn_45))”

    It’s not uncommon to intern as high school students. However, if you’ve already
    passed that phase, don’t fret. This book is to help you with the process.
