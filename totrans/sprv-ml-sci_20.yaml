- en: If you don’t publish the results of your experiments, can it still be considered
    science? If you don’t share your results, others can’t verify or build on your
    work. That’s why publishing is so important in science. When you use machine learning
    in your research, there are additional needs for reporting. You may publish a
    paper but also report on the model or dataset you created. To make reporting easier,
    you can use checklists. Rather than just copying these checklists here – which
    would make for a terrible read – this chapter points you to the best checklists,
    their scope, and the ideas behind them.

    prediction model. The pigeons, the magpies, and, of course, the parrots wanted
    to repeat the Ravens’ success. But they had so many questions, such as what data
    was used in training? Krarah’s disciples were tired of answering the same questions
    over and over again. They decided to compile all the information about the model
    into one document and publish it.

- en: If you use machine learning in your research project, what details should you
    include in your paper? One checklist you might want to use is REFORMS, which stands
    for “Reporting standards for machine learning-based science” [[1]](references.html#ref-kapoor2024reforms).
    The authors developed REFORMS based on literature reviews and a consensus of 19
    researchers from different fields. REFORMS also includes guidelines on completing
    the checklist and identifying potential problems in your modeling approach. REFORMS
    is *field agnostic* – this means the checklist items are broadly applicable, but
    some may be missing depending on your needs.

- en: 'Besides publishing a paper, you may want to share the model. You could just
    upload the model somewhere (like Github) and call it a day. The problem: Other
    researchers and interested parties will have trouble working with your model.
    A standard README file might be too short to describe the model, and a research
    paper might be too long and in the wrong format. The solution: Create a special
    document with your model such as a Model Card. “Model Cards” by Google Research
    [[4]](references.html#ref-mitchell2019model) refers to both the approach and the
    resulting documents. Model Cards is a checklist approach used by many institutions,
    including [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) a large model hub and community

- en: Carefully built and curated datasets are at the heart of machine learning. A
    lot of time and effort can go into collecting and cleaning data. Sometimes years.
    To maximize your return on investment, you might publish the dataset so that others
    can use it and cite your work. But just like the model, the dataset will raise
    a lot of questions if it doesn’t come with the right information. When it comes
    to documentation, it is not wise to reinvent the wheel but to stand on the shoulders
    of giants. In this case, “Datasheets for Datasets” [[6]](references.html#ref-gebru2021datasheets)
    is a popular approach to “facilitate communication between datasets creators and
    consumers.”
