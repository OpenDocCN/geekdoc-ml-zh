- en: Each interviewer is likely to start with a short introduction and one or two
    questions about your background. These questions are to get a sense of who you
    are and maybe to get you more comfortable. For companies that have a dedicated
    behavioral round, this part should be short during the technical interviews. The
    behavioral round may or may not be during lunch, which is usually hosted by the
    hiring manager or a designated behavioral interviewer.

    the company and whether the company can provide an environment for you to thrive.
    They can be grouped into four main topics: your background/resume, your interests,
    your communication style, and your personality.'
