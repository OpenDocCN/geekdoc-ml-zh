- en: If the extent of your ML work will only ever consist of running `keras.fit`
    or cloning existing implementations, you probably don’t need math. There are many
    courses and books that promise you machine learning mastery with little or no
    math at all. If that’s what you’re looking for, feel free to skip this chapter.

    algebra, probability and statistics, dimensionality reduction, and very little
    calculus and convex optimization. This list is far from exhaustive. For example,
    graph theory, logic, topology, and other mathematical branches occur frequently
    in ML but aren’t included here.'
