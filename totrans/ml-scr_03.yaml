- en: 'Variables can be split into two types: the variables we intend to model are
    referred to as **target** or **output** variables, while the variables we use
    to model the target variables are referred to as **predictors**, **features**,
    or **input** variables. These are also known as the *dependent* and *independent*
    variables, respectively.'

- en: An **observation** is a single collection of predictors and target variables.
    Multiple observations with the same variables are combined to form a **dataset**.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **training** dataset is one used to build a machine learning model. A **validation**
    dataset is one used to compare multiple models built on the same training dataset
    with different parameters. A **testing** dataset is one used to evaluate a final
    model.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variables, whether predictors or targets, may be **quantitative** or **categorical**.
    Quantitative variables follow a continuous or near-continuous scale (such as height
    in inches or income in dollars). Categorical variables fall in one of a discrete
    set of groups (such as nation of birth or species type). While the values of categorical
    variables may follow some natural order (such as shirt size), this is not assumed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modeling tasks are referred to as **regression** if the target is quantitative
    and **classification** if the target is categorical. Note that regression does
    not necessarily refer to ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression.

    data and datasets.

- en: Training datasets are assumed to have \(N\) observations and \(D\) predictors.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The vector of features for the \(n^\text{th}\) observation is given by \(\bx_n\).
    Note that \(\bx_n\) might include functions of the original predictors through
    feature engineering. When the target variable is single-dimensional (i.e. there
    is only one target variable per observation), it is given by \(y_n\); when there
    are multiple target variables per observation, the vector of targets is given
    by \(\by_n\).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The entire collection of input and output data is often represented with \(\{\bx_n,
    y_n\}_{n = 1}^N\), which implies observation \(n\) has a multi-dimensional predictor
    vector \(\bx_n\) and a target variable \(y_n\) for \(n = 1, 2, \dots, N\).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many models, such as ordinary linear regression, append an intercept term to
    the predictor vector. When this is the case, \(\bx_n\) will be defined as

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: \[ \bx_n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_{n1} & x_{n2} & ... & x_{nD} \end{pmatrix}.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Feature matrices* or *data frames* are created by concatenating feature vectors
    across observations. Within a matrix, feature vectors are row vectors, with \(\bx_n\)
    representing the matrix’s \(n^\text{th}\) row. These matrices are then given by
    \(\bX\). If a leading 1 is appended to each \(\bx_n\), the first column of the
    corresponding feature matrix \(\bX\) will consist of only 1s.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scalar values will be non-boldface and lowercase, random variables will be non-boldface
    and uppercase, vectors will be bold and lowercase, and matrices will be bold and
    uppercase. E.g. \(b\) is a scalar, \(B\) a random variable, \(\mathbf{b}\) a vector,
    and \(\mathbf{B}\) a matrix.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unless indicated otherwise, all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. Since
    feature vectors (such as \(\bx_n\) and \(\bphi_n\) above) are entered into data
    frames as rows, they will sometimes be treated as row vectors, even outside of
    data frames.

- en: Matrix or vector derivatives, covered in the [math appendix](appendix/math.html),
    will use the numerator [layout convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus#Layout_conventions).
    Let \(\by \in \R^a\) and \(\bx \in \R^b\); under this convention, the derivative
    \(\partial\by/\partial\bx\) is written as

    \\ \dadb{y_2}{x_1} & ... & \dadb{y_2}{x_b} \\ & ... & \\ \dadb{y_a}{x_1} & ...

- en: The likelihood of a parameter \(\theta\) given data \(\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^N\) is
    represented by \(\mathcal{L}\left(\theta; \{x_n\}_{n = 1}^N\right)\). If we are
    considering the data to be random (i.e. not yet observed), it will be written
    as \(\{X_n\}_{n = 1}^N\). If the data in consideration is obvious, we may write
    the likelihood as just \(\mathcal{L}(\theta)\).
