- en: This book is inspired by the [TinyML edX course](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-tiny-machine-learning)
    and CS294r at Harvard University. It represents years of collaboration with students,
    researchers, and practitioners who have shaped its development. We are deeply
    indebted to the folks whose groundbreaking work laid its foundation.

- en: Through this collaboration, our understanding of machine learning systems deepened,
    and we realized that fundamental principles apply across scales, from tiny embedded
    systems to large-scale deployments. This realization shaped the book’s expansion
    beyond TinyML to provide foundations applicable across all scales of machine learning
    systems implementation.
