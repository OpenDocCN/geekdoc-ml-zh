<h1>Modelling A Ticket</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/03_ticket_v1/00_intro.html">https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/03_ticket_v1/00_intro.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>The first chapter should have given you a good grasp over some of Rust's primitive types, operators and
basic control flow constructs.<br/>
In this chapter we'll go one step further and cover what makes Rust truly unique: <strong>ownership</strong>.<br/>
Ownership is what enables Rust to be both memory-safe and performant, with no garbage collector.</p>
<p>As our running example, we'll use a (JIRA-like) ticket, the kind you'd use to track bugs, features, or tasks in
a software project.<br/>
We'll take a stab at modeling it in Rust. It'll be the first iteration—it won't be perfect nor very idiomatic
by the end of the chapter. It'll be enough of a challenge though!<br/>
To move forward you'll have to pick up several new Rust concepts, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>struct</code>s, one of Rust's ways to define custom types</li>
<li>Ownership, references and borrowing</li>
<li>Memory management: stack, heap, pointers, data layout, destructors</li>
<li>Modules and visibility</li>
<li>Strings</li>
</ul>
