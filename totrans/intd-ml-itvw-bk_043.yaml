    his go-to interest question is: “*Think of a period when you were thrilled and
    excited to go to work. What made you excited?*” Was it the problem you were trying
    to solve, the impact you could make, the technologies you had access to, the people
    you worked with, your learning curve, or something else?'

- en: One pet question for many interviewers is “*explain a paper that you really
    like*.” This answer shows not only the kind of problems you’re interested in,
    but also how far you’re willing to go to understand a problem, and how well you
    communicate technical concepts. It doesn’t matter what paper you pick, as long
    as you understand it enough to talk about it. Before your interviews, choose any
    paper, read it inside out and implement it yourself to understand all the subtleties.

    The answer to this question doesn’t even have to be technical. I once told an
    interviewer that I’m most proud of the non-profit organization I started in high-school
    to encourage young people to explore outside their comfort zone. I got an offer.'

    best work, how you handle obstacles. Employers want you to overcome obstacles
    and do your best work at their companies. Companies want passionate people, so
    talk about things that can bring out the fire in your eyes.'
