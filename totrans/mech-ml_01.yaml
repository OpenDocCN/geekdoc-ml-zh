    to speed quickly. You''ll learn how machine learning works and how to apply it
    in practice. We focus on just a few powerful models (algorithms) that are extremely
    effective on real problems, rather than presenting a broad survey of machine learning
    algorithms as many books do. Co-author Jeremy used these few models to become
    the #1 competitor for two consecutive years at Kaggle.com.1 This narrow approach
    leaves lots of room to cover the models, training, and testing in detail, with
    intuitive descriptions and full code implementations.'

- en: Because of our focus, this book does not cover data science in general nor does
    it present any case studies of machine learning from a business perspective. We
    also completely ignore the problem of clustering (unsupervised learning) that
    attempts to group similar data records together (whereas supervised learning maps
    an input record to an output value, such as an image to a category like “it's
    a car”). We find that supervised methods are more often applicable in practice,
    as corroborated by well-known machine learning researcher Andrew Ng.2

    model requires experience. This book is opinionated in the sense that we have
    chosen a single powerful model for you, *Random Forests* (TM), that will work
    in the vast majority of cases. {TODO: analogy: It''s best not to start out trying
    10 different foreign languages; better to focus on one.} We''ll also explore *k-nearest
    neighbors*, *decision trees*, and *linear regression* models along the way in
    order to explain and motivate our “power tools,” random forests and neural networks.
    Part of our goal with this book is to show that, while there are lots of details,
    the overall process of applying machine learning is pretty straightforward. In
    fact, we''ll look at a broadly-applicable recipe in [workflow].'

- en: Computer programming is required to do machine learning and programmers are
    the primary target audience of this book. In particular, you really need at least
    one solid year of programming experience, preferably in Python. Python is the
    most common programming language used in machine learning and so it is the language
    we use in this book. If you don't already know Python, those with sufficient experience
    can learn it on the fly while reading. Others should spend some time getting comfortable
    with basic Python before reading this book.

    to understand machine learning. Don't worry! You'll be fine if you can dredge
    up some high school level algebra and geometry. As a happy coincidence, the models
    and techniques we explore in this book require very little mathematics background,
    even when we get to deep learning (neural networks). Some models require sophisticated
    mathematics to understand (for example, “support vector machines” and “hidden
    Markoff models”) but they are used much less frequently than mathematically-simpler
    but still powerful models like “Random Forests.”

- en: Advancement mathematics is most often necessary when we try to prove a model's
    correctness, define model performance bounds, compare different models abstractly,
    design new models, and so on. In other words, to become a machine learning researcher
    you need serious math chops. Our goal, on the other hand, is to cover only as
    much mathematics as necessary to get you applying machine learning effectively
    in your job. As we go along, we'll cover any mathematics and notation needed for
    each discussion.

- en: 'Even when mathematics is necessary to understand a model, it''s important to
    remember that the math notation is really just a precise and concise way to express
    the results of someone''s intuitive leap. Consider the Pythagorean theorem we
    all learned in middle school: ![](../Images/f5ea1ae38b0a0a763bace3fca73ffa78.png).
    Pythagoras could never have expressed his theorem with such a formula. As Steven
    Weinberg points out, “*The Greeks never learned to write and manipulate algebraic
    formulas*.”3 (Terence highly recommends this book.) Instead, Pythagoras arranged
    three squares so their edges formed a right triangle (one angle is 90 degrees)
    then observed that the area of the square whose edge formed the hypotenuse had
    the same area as the combined area of the other two squares; see **Figure 1.1**.
    It''s pretty hard to start from the mathematics and work backwards to the intuition,
    which is why we''re going to spend most of our time with the ideas and mechanisms
    behind machine learning.'
