- en: Linear regression can be extended in a number of ways to fit various modeling
    needs. [Regularized regression](s1/regularized.html) penalizes the magnitude of
    the regression coefficients to avoid *overfitting*, which is particularly helpful
    for models using a large number of predictors. [Bayesian regression](s1/bayesian.html)
    places a prior distribution on the regression coefficients in order to reconcile
    existing beliefs about these parameters with information gained from new data.
    Finally, generalized linear models ([GLMs](s1/GLMs.html)) expand on ordinary linear
    regression by changing the assumed error structure and allowing for the expected
    value of the target variable to be a nonlinear function of the predictors. These
    extensions are described, derived, and demonstrated in detail this chapter.
