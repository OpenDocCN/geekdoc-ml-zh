    models. While the complex dance between prediction and science is age-old, supervised
    machine learning is relatively young. Let’s find out how this algorithmic approach
    to learning from data fits into science.

    and his theory of general relativity, one of the biggest success stories of science.
    Inspired by theoretical and philosophical reflections such as the principle of
    relativity, Mach’s principle, and the equivalence principle[¹](#fn1), Einstein
    described a theory according to which gravity is a geometric property of space
    and time. When Einstein developed his theory between 1907 and 1915, it was, unlike
    his theory of special relativity, not based on novel empirical observations that
    the old theory did not account for. Instead, Einstein was driven by intuition,
    a desire to generalize, and mathematical beauty. Still, Einstein’s theory provided
    what elevated it beyond purely philosophical speculation: It made predictions.'

    like the existence of gravitational waves, took until 2015 to be confirmed because
    they required complex new technologies of measurement. It is surprising how long
    Einstein’s theory has lasted and how correct its predictions are until today –
    the general theory of relativity is among the best-tested theories in science.

    of aspects of phenomena that allow scientists to predict, explain, or reason about
    these phenomena. Models can be grounded in theory or even be applications of theories
    to a specific context. For instance, Richardson used theories from physics to
    build his weather forecasting model. However, models don’t have to be closely
    tied to theory. They can also rely on data or common sense. Contrary to theories,
    models are often more concrete with a smaller scope and more practical. Evidence
    incompatible with the model just limits the scope of the model, but an otherwise
    useful model might still survive. Different models for similar aspects of reality
    can coexist in a field even if they are in conflict.*  *Unfortunately, his first
    attempts were unsuccessful. It took him **six weeks** to make a weather forecast
    for a **six-hour** time frame. Even worse, his predictions were pretty far off!
    Nevertheless, methodologically, he was on the right track; while first ignored
    after its publication in 1922, his book “Weather Prediction by Numerical Process”
    is now a modern classic in meteorology. Up until today, scientists use numerical
    methods, physical measurements, and physical theories to forecast the weather
    [[2]](references.html#ref-pu2019numerical). Fortunately, numerical weather forecasts
    have substantially improved since Richardson’s first attempt. The availability
    of atmospheric data, e.g., via airplanes or weather stations, and even more importantly,
    the access to electronic computers that can solve differential equations efficiently
    in real-time, allow to predict the weather (at least within 24 hours) reliably.
    Weather forecasts have become so reliable that when you ask a friend about the
    weather at the moment, she may check her weather app instead of looking outside

    weather forecasting. If the predictions of general relativity had been incorrect,
    the theory would have been thrown on the scrap heap of science, no matter how
    beautiful it was. Similarly, if numerical weather forecasting did not work, it
    would be ignored; in fact, this is exactly what initially happened to Richardson
    when he proposed his theory.

    guided new experiments such as the search for black holes, confirmed the theory,
    and had in the beginning very few practical implications.[³](#fn3) In weather
    science, on the other hand, accurate prediction is ultimately the goal; also because
    controlling the weather is at least so far out of reach. Weather predictions are
    useful: They help people decide when to leave the house, when to harvest plants,
    how to schedule flights, when to expect catastrophic weather events, and tell
    your trusted ice shop when to open. Prediction is not a nice byproduct of weather
