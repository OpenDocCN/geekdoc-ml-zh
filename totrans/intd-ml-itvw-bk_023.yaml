- en: Another important distinction is between companies that build enterprise products
    (B2B - business to business) and companies that build customer products (B2C -
    business to consumer).

- en: B2B companies build products for organizations. Examples of enterprise products
    are Customer relationship management (CRM) software, project management tools,
    database management systems, cloud hosting services, etc.

    are social networks, search engines, ride-sharing services, health trackers, etc.

    also offer plans for enterprise users. For example, Google Drive can be used by
    anyone but they also have Google Drive for Enterprise.

- en: 'Even if a B2C company doesn’t create products for enterprises directly, they
    might still need to sell to enterprises. For example, Facebook’s main product
    is used by individuals but they sell ads to enterprises. Some might argue that
    this makes Facebook users products, as famously quipped: “If you’re not paying
    for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.^([14](#fn_14))”'

- en: These two types of companies have different sales strategies and engineering
    requirements. Consumer products tend to rely on viral marketing (e.g. invite your
    friends and get your next order for free) to reach a large number of users. Selling
    enterprise products tends to require selling to each user separately.

    to be evaluated differently when you consider joining them.
