    different candidates for the same role the same questions are process-driven,
    not people-driven.

    question becomes slightly easier, but there’s still room for the candidate to
    show off their skills.

- en: Ask hard questions. Extraordinary candidates can write up a simple solution
    within an hour, and there’s no upper bound on how much a candidate can improve
    the solution. Asking hard questions shows that you think about and work on hard
    problems, which attracts people who want to solve hard problems.

    skills instead of techniques. Techniques change over time, but critical thinking
    and problem-solving skills will always be relevant.

    but also the log of the questions and answers should be submitted.
