    their immutable borrow form (`&str` and `&[T]`).

- en: 'When working with immutable borrows, the recommendation was clear: prefer slice
    references over references to the owned type (e.g. `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>`).'

- en: '`push` is a method on `Vec`, not on slices. This is the manifestation of a
    more general principle: Rust won''t allow you to add or remove elements from a
    slice. You will only be able to modify/replace the elements that are already there.'

- en: In this regard, a `&mut Vec` or a `&mut String` are strictly more powerful than
    a `&mut [T]` or a `&mut str`.
