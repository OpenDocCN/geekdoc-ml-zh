- en: At some companies, you might encounter roles involving applied research. Applied
    research is somewhere between research and production, but much closer to research
    than production. Applied research involves finding solutions to practical problems,
    but doesn’t involve implementing those solutions in actual production environments.

- en: Applied researchers are researchers. They come up with novel hypotheses and
    theses as well as validate them. However, since their hypotheses and theses deal
    with practical problems, they need to understand these problems as well. In industry
    lingo, they need to have **subject matter expertise**.

- en: In machine learning, an example of a research project would be to develop an
    unsupervised transfer learning method for computer vision, experiment on a standard
    academic dataset. An example of an applied research project would be to develop
    techniques to make that new method work on a real-world problem in a specific
    industry, e.g. healthcare. People working on this applied research project will,
    therefore, need to have expertise in both machine learning and healthcare.
