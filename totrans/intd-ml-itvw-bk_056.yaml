- en: As level increases, base salary and bonus increase slowly, but equity increases
    the most. For junior levels, base salary makes up the largest chunk of your direct
    compensations. As you level up, the proportion of equity goes up -- higher equity
    reflects more responsibilities you have towards the company’s success.
