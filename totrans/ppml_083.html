<h1>A dedicated Client type</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/07_threads/08_client.html">https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/07_threads/08_client.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>All the interactions from the client side have been fairly low-level: you have to
manually create a response channel, build the command, send it to the server, and
then call <code>recv</code> on the response channel to get the response.</p>
<p>This is a lot of boilerplate code that could be abstracted away, and that's
exactly what we're going to do in this exercise.</p>
