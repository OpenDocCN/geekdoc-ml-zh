<h1>The zen of interviews</h1>

<li>The goal of the hiring process is to hire people, not to eliminate them.</li>
<li>Interview questions should be tailored for each candidate. Companies who ask different candidates for the same role the same questions are process-driven, not people-driven.</li>
<li>Standardized interview questions lead to standardized answers which, in turn, leads to standardized people.</li>
<li>If a piece of knowledge is easy to acquire, it’s not worth testing for.</li>
<li>Ask questions with multiple hurdles. After giving the candidate a hint, the question becomes slightly easier, but there’s still room for the candidate to show off their skills.</li>
<li>Ask hard questions. Extraordinary candidates can write up a simple solution within an hour, and there’s no upper bound on how much a candidate can improve the solution. Asking hard questions shows that you think about and work on hard problems, which attracts people who want to solve hard problems.</li>
<li>A good interview is a question that turns into a conversation.</li>
<li>For long-term hires, interviews should focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills instead of techniques. Techniques change over time, but critical thinking and problem-solving skills will always be relevant.</li>
<li>Both interviewers’ and candidates’ time should be respected.</li>
<li>Interviews should be transparent. For each interview, not only the final evaluation but also the log of the questions and answers should be submitted.</li>
