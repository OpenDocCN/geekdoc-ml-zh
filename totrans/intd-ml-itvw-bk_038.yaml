- en: Hiring at a small company is very different from hiring at a big company. One
    reason is that big companies make a lot of hires, so they need to standardize
    their process. Small companies refine the process as they go. Another reason is
    that big companies can afford to occasionally make bad hires, whereas a few bad
    hires can run a small company into the ground.

- en: As a result, processes at smaller companies can adapt to each role and each
    candidate. Processes at big companies can be rigid and bureaucratic and might
    involve questions irrelevant to the role or the candidate. The standardization
    at big companies also means that the process is more hackable -- thorough preparation
    can substantially increase your odds.

- en: Another important difference is that big companies can afford to hire specialists,
    who are great in only a small area. Startups are unpredictable and ever-changing,
    so they might care less about what you do best and more about whether you can
    address their most urgent needs.
