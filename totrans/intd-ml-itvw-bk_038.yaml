- en: Hiring at a small company is very different from hiring at a big company. One
    reason is that big companies make a lot of hires, so they need to standardize
    their process. Small companies refine the process as they go. Another reason is
    that big companies can afford to occasionally make bad hires, whereas a few bad
    hires can run a small company into the ground.

  zh: 在小公司招聘与在大公司招聘非常不同。一个原因是大公司需要招聘大量人员，因此他们需要标准化他们的流程。小公司则是在过程中不断优化流程。另一个原因是大公司偶尔可以承担错误的招聘，而几个错误的招聘可能会把小公司拖垮。
- en: As a result, processes at smaller companies can adapt to each role and each
    candidate. Processes at big companies can be rigid and bureaucratic and might
    involve questions irrelevant to the role or the candidate. The standardization
    at big companies also means that the process is more hackable -- thorough preparation
    can substantially increase your odds.

  zh: 因此，小公司的流程可以适应每个角色和每个候选人。大公司的流程可能比较僵化和官僚，可能包括与角色或候选人无关的问题。大公司的标准化也意味着流程更容易被破解——充分的准备可以显著提高你的胜算。
- en: Another important difference is that big companies can afford to hire specialists,
    who are great in only a small area. Startups are unpredictable and ever-changing,
    so they might care less about what you do best and more about whether you can
    address their most urgent needs.

  zh: 另一个重要的区别是，大公司可以承担聘请专家的费用，这些专家只在很小的领域内很出色。初创公司不可预测且不断变化，因此他们可能更关心你是否能解决他们最紧迫的需求，而不是你擅长做什么。
