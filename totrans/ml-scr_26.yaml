- en: This section demonstrates constructions of bagging models, random forests, and
    boosting for classification and regression. Each of these relies on the decision
    tree constructions from the [last chapter](../c5/construction.html). Bagging and
    random forests involve simple combinations of decision trees with only minor adjustments
    to the tree structure; therefore, the code for those sections is limited. The
    section on boosting involves more original code.
