<p>In Part <a href="design-code.html#"><strong>2</strong></a> we discussed how we may adapt software engineering practices to the development of machine
learning pipelines. Practices are predicated on the tools we adopt to implement them, which will be the focus of Part
<a href="development-tools.html#"><strong>3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we present an up-to-date selection of tools for data exploration, experiment tracking (Section
<a href="development-tools.html#exploration-experiment-tracking">10.1</a>), for developing code (Section <a href="development-tools.html#code-development">10.2</a>) and for building, testing
and documenting it (Section <a href="development-tools.html#build-test-doc-tools">10.3</a>). Together, these tools provide a development environment
suitable for creating machine learning pipelines. We will then move to those used to manage pipelines in production and
maintain them (Chapter <a href="production-tools.html#production-tools">11</a>). We fully expect that the tools available at the time of this writing
will consolidate over time, as has happened to other types of productivity tools in software engineering and systems
administration.</p>
<div id="exploration-experiment-tracking" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Data Exploration and Experiment Tracking<a href="development-tools.html#exploration-experiment-tracking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>Many issues in machine learning pipelines can be traced to data that are not sufficiently clean or well-structured and
therefore are not suitable for training or inference. Early exploratory analyses, together with domain experts, will
improve our understanding of the data and can help us improve their quality to the point where we can address the issues
we discussed in Section <a href="design-code.html#data-debt">5.2.1</a> and <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#data-problems">9.1</a>. The code we write in these explorations is the
initial prototype that, after much polishing and refactoring, will become the data ingestion and preparation modules of
the pipeline (Section <a href="design-code.html#data-pipeline">5.3.3</a>). Using a programmatic approach to data exploration, cleaning and
transformation is always preferable because it provides reproducible results and enables code versioning (Section
<a href="writing-code.html#versioning">6.5</a>). The code we produce should be tested using property-based testing (Section <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#testing-what">9.4.2</a>) with
sample data to check whether it works correctly; the same tests can be reused as quality gates for new data during the
pipeline lifetime. We will suggest different tools to write such code in Section <a href="development-tools.html#code-development">10.2</a>: notebooks like
Jupyter <span class="citation">(Project Jupyter <a href="#ref-jupyter" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>; IDEs like RStudio <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-r-studio" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-r-studio" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>; Python libraries like NumPy <span class="citation">(Harris et al. <a href="#ref-numpy" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> and Pandas <span class="citation">(McKinney <a href="#ref-pandas" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>; R packages
like dplyr <span class="citation">(Wickham, François, et al. <a href="#ref-dplyr" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, tidyr <span class="citation">(Wickham, Girlich, and RStudio <a href="#ref-tidyr" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and janitor <span class="citation">(Firke et al. <a href="#ref-janitor" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> are just a few examples. In addition, most integrated MLOps
tools incorporate experiment tracking, so we can save these explorations in a centralised and versioned repository and
then compare different approaches and their parameters on the basis of the metrics that we chose (Section
<a href="design-code.html#scoping-pipeline">5.3.1</a>) for model evaluation and validation (Section <a href="design-code.html#model-pipeline">5.3.4</a>).

</p>
<p>

In addition, high-level visual tools to explore and clean the data may be useful to involve domain experts who may not
be comfortable with programming. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Openrefine <span class="citation">(Openrefine <a href="#ref-openrefine" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>: an open-source client-server solution that provides a collaborative web interface for
working on data, as well as client libraries to automate tasks using the API exposed by the server.</li>
<li>Trifacta <span class="citation">(Trifacta <a href="#ref-trifacta" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>: a commercial solution that provides an easy-to-use interface to work on data quality, data
transformation and data processing pipelines in general. It is designed for non-technical users and supports
deployment on all major cloud providers.</li>
<li>Tableau Prep Builder <span class="citation">(Tableau Software <a href="#ref-tableau" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>: offers a straightforward interface to interactively clean, format and visualise data
from different sources. It is available both as a local, graphical application and as a web application.</li>
<li>Web solutions like Airtable <span class="citation">(Formagrid <a href="#ref-airtable" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, which provides the functionality of a database combined with the features of
a spreadsheet, may also be suitable for working on small datasets in a collaborative manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data exploration is an iterative process: interactively visualising its outputs as they change is essential. We can do
that directly from the Python and R code we use to explore the data if we are using either Jupyter or RMarkdown
<span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund <a href="#ref-rmarkdown" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. As an alternative, we can produce a dedicated interactive dashboard from Python, R, Julia or Bokeh
<span class="citation">(Bokeh <a href="#ref-bokeh" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> code and from Jupyter notebooks with a visual tool like Tableau <span class="citation">(Tableau Software <a href="#ref-tableau" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> or with a programmatic tool like
Dash <span class="citation">(Plotly <a href="#ref-dash" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-dash" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> that can generate one. We will discuss more tools in Section <a href="production-tools.html#production-dashboard">11.3</a>.</p>
<p>If the data are too large for the tools above to handle, we can store them using “big data” frameworks based on Hadoop
<span class="citation">(The Apache Software Foundation <a href="#ref-hadoop" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-hadoop" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span> like Cloudera <span class="citation">(Cloudera <a href="#ref-cloudera" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. We can then use tools like Apache Pig <span class="citation">(The Apache Software Foundation <a href="#ref-pig" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-pig" role="doc-biblioref">e</a>)</span>, Apache Hive <span class="citation">(The Apache Software Foundation <a href="#ref-hive" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-hive" role="doc-biblioref">d</a>)</span>, Apache Impala
<span class="citation">(Apache Software Foundation <a href="#ref-apache-impala" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-apache-impala" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> and Apache Spark <span class="citation">(The Apache Software Foundation <a href="#ref-spark" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-spark" role="doc-biblioref">f</a>)</span> to manipulate them and implement our own data ingestion and cleaning; or we
can use integrated cloud-based solutions like Snowflake <span class="citation">(Snowflake <a href="#ref-snowflake" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Databricks Lakehouse <span class="citation">(Databricks <a href="#ref-databricks" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. The
advantage of these integrated solutions is that they handle all the aspects of data management as well as machine
learning applications development and delivery, supporting integration with data engineering, data science and machine
learning open-source projects.</p>
<p>Databricks, for instance, includes many open-source components. One is Delta Lake <span class="citation">(The Delta Lake Project Authors <a href="#ref-delta-lake" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-delta-lake" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>: an abstraction layer
for existing data lakes and object storage like S3 which is fully compatible with Apache Spark and which supports
features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcing and data versioning. Databricks also offers a managed version of
MLflow <span class="citation">(Zaharia and The Linux Foundation <a href="#ref-mlflow" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> an open-source library-agnostic platform to manage machine learning pipelines which we will describe in
more detail in Section <a href="production-tools.html#production-software">11.2</a>.
</p>
<p>
DVC (Data Version Control) <span class="citation">(Iterative <a href="#ref-dvc" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-dvc" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> is an open-source tool that applies GitOps principles to data.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> DVC manages data and machine learning models through metadata stored in
text files, and it uses Git <span class="citation">(The Git Development Team <a href="#ref-git-git" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> to version them and to track their provenance. DVC is both a command-line tool
and a library, and is language- and framework-agnostic.</p>
<p>DVC and MLflow <span class="citation">(Zaharia and The Linux Foundation <a href="#ref-mlflow" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> implement experiment tracking in two different ways. DVC organises experiments within Git
projects using commits, branches and tags. It automatically tracks data dependencies, machine learning code, parameters
and model artefacts: we can compare different experiments through the associated metrics using either its command line
or its web interface. MLflow instead provides a tracking server and client libraries that can be integrated into Python,
R and Java code as discussed in Section <a href="design-code.html#monitoring-pipeline">5.3.6</a>. The tracking server stores the metadata,
parameters, metrics and tags collected by the clients for each experiment run into a file or a database. Larger outputs
like data files, images and model artefacts are saved separately, for instance, in an object storage.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also proprietary SaaS offerings with experiment tracking and model registry functionalities, to
name a few: Neptune <span class="citation">(Neptune Labs <a href="#ref-neptune" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, Comet <span class="citation">(Comet <a href="#ref-comet" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Weights &amp; Biases <span class="citation">(Weights &amp; Biases <a href="#ref-wab" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>; more details on this type of software are in
Section <a href="production-tools.html#production-software">11.2</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Code Development<a href="development-tools.html#code-development" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>


Modern software development is a collaborative effort based on knowledge sharing, constant iteration and continuous
feedback. Distributed version control systems and Git <span class="citation">(The Git Development Team <a href="#ref-git-git" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> in particular make all this possible by setting the
standard for code versioning and collaborative development and by powering popular platforms such as GitHub and GitLab.
Our ability to deliver and deploy software using DevOps relies heavily on Git together with semantic versioning
<span class="citation">(Preston-Werner <a href="#ref-sem-ver" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and commit tags. Therefore, Git is a tool that every software engineer should be familiar with. Machine
learning and data science professionals should be familiar with it as well because it is used in and influences the
design of software like DVC that is used to work with pipelines.</p>
<p>
Choosing the right set of tools for writing code is a matter of prior experience with specific tools and personal taste.
It may be a decision made either by individual developers or at the level of the team, research group or company the
developers belong to in order to standardise on a predetermined set of software. In either case, to work efficiently on
a machine learning pipeline we will need support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programming languages that we will use (Section <a href="writing-code.html#programming-language">6.1</a>);</li>
<li>enforcing coding standards (Section <a href="writing-code.html#coding-standards">6.3</a>);</li>
<li>automated refactoring (Section <a href="writing-code.html#refactoring">6.7</a>);</li>
<li>integrations with source code versioning (Section <a href="writing-code.html#versioning">6.5</a>);</li>
<li>running software tests and summarising their results (Section <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#testing">9.4</a>);</li>
<li>interactive debugging (Section <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#testing">9.4</a>);</li>
<li>managing the containers (Section <a href="deploying-code.html#container-packaging">7.1.4</a>) that encapsulate the developing environment, and the
ability to remotely work within them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring that all developers use similar tooling is useful for compliance, to simplify the training of new developers
and to improve reproducibility. (For the same reasons, we should avoid polyglot programming as discussed in Section
<a href="design-code.html#code-debt">5.2.4</a>). There is a wide variety of tools to choose from, falling into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>modern and relatively lightweight <em>code editors</em> such as Atom <span class="citation">(Atom <a href="#ref-atom" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Visual Studio Code <span class="citation">(Microsoft <a href="#ref-vs-code" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-vs-code" role="doc-biblioref">d</a>, also known as
VS Code)</span> that can be extended to provide the features above with the use of third-party extensions;</li>
<li><em>integrated development environments</em> (IDEs) such as Eclipse <span class="citation">(Eclipse Foundation <a href="#ref-eclipse-ide" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-eclipse-ide" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> and JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA
<span class="citation">(JetBrains <a href="#ref-jetbrains-idea" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-jetbrains-idea" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>;</li>
<li><em>shared interactive computing platforms</em> such as Jupyter notebooks <span class="citation">(Project Jupyter <a href="#ref-jupyter" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
<div id="editors" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="10.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.2.1</span> Code Editors and IDEs<a href="development-tools.html#editors" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>
The main difference between an IDE and a code editor is the amount of functionality that is built-in and configured with
sane defaults. On the one hand, IDEs integrate most functionality out of the box on a single programming language. For
instance, PyCharm <span class="citation">(JetBrains <a href="#ref-pycharm" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-pycharm" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> offers features such as code inspection, code completion, syntax highlighting, version
control, debugging, refactoring, test execution and container integration like other major IDEs, but also supports the
Python REPL and provides introspection into the objects created by scientific computing libraries such as NumPy and
Pandas. The reference IDE for the R language is RStudio <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-r-studio" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-r-studio" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, which integrates a console, an editor that supports
syntax highlighting and direct code execution, tools for plotting and inspecting R objects as well as history,
debugging and workspace management.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, code editors are more limited out of the box, but they can reach feature parity with IDEs by
installing and configuring third-party extensions. For example, VS Code can provide similar functionality to PyCharm by
using a language server like the <em>Python Language Server</em> <span class="citation">(Palantir <a href="#ref-python-language-server" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> that is compliant with the language
server protocol specification <span class="citation">(Microsoft <a href="#ref-lsp" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-lsp" role="doc-biblioref">f</a>)</span>. Other alternatives are Mypy <span class="citation">(The mypy Project <a href="#ref-mypy" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, Pylance <span class="citation">(Microsoft <a href="#ref-pylance" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-pylance" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> (based on the
Pyright <span class="citation">(Pyright <a href="#ref-pyright" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> static type checker from Microsoft), Pytype <span class="citation">(Batchelder and et al. <a href="#ref-pytype" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> (from Google) and Pyre <span class="citation">(Meta Platforms <a href="#ref-pyre" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-pyre" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> (from
Facebook). The same level of integration can be accomplished with the languageserver package <span class="citation">(Lai and Ren <a href="#ref-r-languageserver" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and the
VS Code R extension <span class="citation">(REditorSupport <a href="#ref-vs-code-r" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> for R and with LanguageServer.jl <span class="citation">(Julia VS Code <a href="#ref-julia-languageserver" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-julia-languageserver" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> and the VS Code Julia
extension <span class="citation">(Julia VS Code <a href="#ref-vs-code-julia" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-vs-code-julia" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> for Julia.</p>
<p>



Both code editors and IDEs can also run as web applications: a web browser session connects to a cloud instance
replicating a common, unified development environment. This approach has two advantages: it reduces technical debt
arising from polyglot programming (Section <a href="design-code.html#code-debt">5.2.4</a>) and makes it possible to develop in environments that
are too complex or too resource-intensive to run locally (Section <a href="design-code.html#baseline-pipeline">5.3.2</a>). Code
editors like VS Code provide web interfaces <span class="citation">(Microsoft <a href="#ref-vscode-dev" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-vscode-dev" role="doc-biblioref">j</a>)</span> to navigate files and repositories and to commit small code
changes, while IDEs like GitHub Codespaces <span class="citation">(GitHub <a href="#ref-github-codespaces" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-github-codespaces" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> and AWS Cloud9 <span class="citation">(Amazon <a href="#ref-aws-cloud9" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-aws-cloud9" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span> provide complete cloud
development environments backed by virtual machines (Section <a href="deploying-code.html#vm-packaging">7.1.3</a>). We also have the option to self-host
them using Docker <span class="citation">(Docker <a href="#ref-docker" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-docker" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> and Kubernetes <span class="citation">(The Kubernetes Authors <a href="#ref-kubernetes" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-kubernetes" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>: base container images are readily available for Eclipse Che
<span class="citation">(Eclipse Che <a href="#ref-eclipse-che" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, Eclipse Theia <span class="citation">(Eclipse Foundation <a href="#ref-eclipse-theia" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-eclipse-theia" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> and GitPod <span class="citation">(Gitpod <a href="#ref-gitpod" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. As for R, RStudio Server <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-r-studio-server" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-r-studio-server" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> makes
available the same features as the RStudio IDE through a browser-based interface that is connected to R sessions running
on a remote server. We would also like to point out DagsHub <span class="citation">(DagsHub <a href="#ref-dagshub" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> as a collaboration platform: it provides a shared
work environment for data science and machine learning projects that follows the development patterns and the practices
presented in this book. It integrates with GitHub, DVC, MLflow, Jenkins <span class="citation">(Jenkins <a href="#ref-jenkins" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-jenkins" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> and many other open-source tools.


</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to mention one last set of code editors: Vim, Neovim <span class="citation">(Neovim <a href="#ref-neovim" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Emacs <span class="citation">(GNU Project <a href="#ref-gnu-emacs" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. They are
valued by developers who prefer to create a modular development environment that fits their specific needs. Both editors
provide full support for R, Julia and Python through plug-ins that communicate with the respective language servers.
Although their learning curve is steep at first, they allow for unparalleled speed of action on code bases of any size
in the long run.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.2.2</span> Notebooks<a href="development-tools.html#notebooks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>
In recent years, notebooks have seen widespread adoption in machine learning projects and, more in general, in
scientific research. They are typically implemented as Jupyter notebooks <span class="citation">(Project Jupyter <a href="#ref-jupyter" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>, from the programming languages
<em>Ju</em>lia, <em>Pyt</em>hon and <em>R</em> they support)</span>, an interactive development tool that is ideal for building proofs of concept.
Jupyter notebooks are designed to quickly test ideas, to evaluate the trade-offs of different alternatives and to share
code, results and figures intermixed with documentation in Markdown format. They can be executed interactively directly
from GitHub and GitLab, from a dedicated collaboration platform such as Google Colaboratory <span class="citation">(Google <a href="#ref-colab" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-colab" role="doc-biblioref">g</a>, also known as
Colab)</span> or from MLOps platforms such as Amazon SageMaker <span class="citation">(Amazon <a href="#ref-sagemaker" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-sagemaker" role="doc-biblioref">d</a>)</span> or Azure Machine Learning <span class="citation">(Microsoft <a href="#ref-azureml" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-azureml" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite considerable programming language support and a significant adoption by the scientific community, the use of
Jupyter notebooks has several shortcomings in the context of modern development practices (Chapter <a href="writing-code.html#writing-code">6</a>,
in particular Section <a href="writing-code.html#coding-standards">6.3</a>). The Jupyter notebook file format stores code, outputs, images and
Markdown text in a single huge JSON object to produce a self-contained, portable artefact. This architectural choice has
four major shortcomings:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is challenging to version a notebook correctly because stochastic outputs change every time it runs.</li>
<li>Representing code in “cells” that can be executed in any order is at odds with the imperative nature of the
programming languages used in machine learning software.</li>
<li>Dividing code into cells to interleave their outputs and the surrounding text impacts code modularity and code reuse
and reduces our ability to produce good abstractions. We can accept some level of coupling between cells (because
they run code in a shared, hidden global environment) and add glue code to make things work, but that leads to an
increase in technical debt (Sections <a href="design-code.html#architecture-debt">5.2.3</a> and <a href="design-code.html#code-debt">5.2.4</a>).</li>
<li>Notebooks do not have any built-in support for automated testing (Section <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#testing">9.4</a>) or deployment (Chapter
<a href="deploying-code.html#deploying-code">7</a>). While this can be acceptable for exploring data and prototyping models
(Section <a href="design-code.html#baseline-pipeline">5.3.2</a>), it makes them unsuitable for developing production-level software.</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, executing cells in a non-linear order can lead to inconsistent results because cells affect each other’s
environment, effectively creating a “hidden state” that is very difficult to track. The only way to achieve
reproducibility is to always execute all the code in the notebook from the top in a clean environment. For these
reasons, we cannot use notebooks directly to serve machine learning models in a production environment. However,
this may change in the future: there are ongoing efforts to develop tools for diffing and merging (nbtime <span class="citation">(Alnæs and Project Jupyter <a href="#ref-nbdime" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and
nbstripout <span class="citation">(Rathgeber <a href="#ref-nbstripout" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>), automatic testing (testbook <span class="citation">(Nteract Team <a href="#ref-testbook" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-testbook" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> and nbval <span class="citation">(Cortes-Ortuno et al. <a href="#ref-nbval" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>), automation (Papermill
<span class="citation">(Nteract Team <a href="#ref-papermill" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-papermill" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>) and quality assurance (nbQA <span class="citation">(nbQA Team <a href="#ref-nbqa" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>RMarkdown and Julia notebooks are fully reproducible because they execute all the code in the notebook from the top in a
clean environment by default, so there is no state inconsistency after we change the code in a cell and re-run it.
Furthermore, both are easier to version and to diff than Jupyter notebooks because they store text, outputs and figures
in a separate Markdown, PDF or HTML file when compiled. RMarkdown notebooks are well supported by RStudio,
which provides code auto-complete, linting and suggestions, but they can be edited with any text editor and compiled
through the command line as well. We can also enhance them with the workflowr R package <span class="citation">(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens <a href="#ref-workflowr" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, which combines
literate programming (with knitr <span class="citation">(Xie <a href="#ref-knitr" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>) and version control (with git2r <span class="citation">(Widgren and et al. <a href="#ref-git2r" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>) to generate shareable HTML pages
containing time-stamped, versioned code blocks and outputs. For reproducibility, each analysis is run in a new R
session.</p>
<p>Given how Jupyter notebooks are geared towards prototyping, we suggest that they should be integrated in a modern
development workflow as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Experiment and build a prototype of the code using notebooks.</li>
<li>When the prototype is complete, move the code to a new Git repository and start refactoring it using an IDE or a code
editor to make it modular and scalable. At the same time, add software tests.</li>
<li>Add docstrings <span class="citation">(Goodger and Rossum <a href="#ref-py-docstrings" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> to the code using the text in Jupyter Markdown as a base.</li>
<li>Package your artefact using pip <span class="citation">(Python Software Foundation <a href="#ref-pip" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-pip" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> and setuptool <span class="citation">(Python Packaging Authority <a href="#ref-setuptools" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> (Section <a href="deploying-code.html#distribution-packaging">7.1.2</a>) for later
use as a module within the machine learning pipeline or as a library that will be imported by other Jupyter
notebooks.
</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.2.3</span> Accessing Data and Documentation<a href="development-tools.html#accessing-documentation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>

Quickly accessing documentation during development is invaluable when working on complex code bases. We can use offline
documentation browsers such as Velocity <span class="citation">(Silverlake Software <a href="#ref-velocity" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> or Dash, or the open-source Zeal <span class="citation">(The Delta Lake Project Authors <a href="#ref-zeal" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-zeal" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>. All three can
automatically download the <em>docsets</em> (HTML documentation archives for offline usage) for major programming languages and
machine learning frameworks, and also integrate with the leading IDEs and code editors. Overall, they are
interchangeable in terms of features.</p>
<p>As for accessing data, object storage like AWS Amazon S3 is becoming the de facto standard for data interchange in
data science and machine learning. Therefore, it is very useful to integrate code editors and IDEs with libraries
capable of abstracting the listing, downloading and uploading of data into object storage buckets across multiple cloud
vendors. A popular example is MinIO <span class="citation">(MinIO <a href="#ref-minio" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, which is fully compatible with the S3 APIs and provides an open-source SDK
for multiple languages.

</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Build, Test and Documentation Tools<a href="development-tools.html#build-test-doc-tools" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>Using appropriate tools for building, testing and performing software quality assurance is important to improve
ergonomics and reduce the likelihood of errors. In addition, we may want to use the same set of tools in all
environments (developer workstations, staging and production environments) and in all stages of development, both to
avoid inconsistencies and to maintain a common environment shared by all the people who work on the pipeline.</p>
<p>

Currently, containers (Section <a href="deploying-code.html#container-packaging">7.1.4</a>) are the most common way of packaging the modules of a machine
learning pipeline: either individually with Docker, in groups with Docker compose <span class="citation">(Docker <a href="#ref-docker-compose" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-docker-compose" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span> or Podman <span class="citation">(The Containers Organization <a href="#ref-podman" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>,
or as a single-node Kubernetes with Minikube <span class="citation">(The Kubernetes Authors <a href="#ref-minikube" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-minikube" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span> or MicroK8s <span class="citation">(Canonical <a href="#ref-microk8s" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-microk8s" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>. All these solutions build on Docker,
with different trade-offs in terms of architecture and functionality, and therefore support the deployment practices
described in Chapter <a href="deploying-code.html#deploying-code">7</a>.</p>
<p>One of the points of using containers is to isolate different modules and applications from each other. We can further
decouple our code from the software installed within each container by using <code>pipenv</code> or <code>pip</code> <span class="citation">(Python Software Foundation <a href="#ref-pip" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-pip" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> plus <code>virtualenv</code>
<span class="citation">(Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) <a href="#ref-virtualenv" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> to create isolated Python environments and to manage dependencies on packages and on specific versions of
the Python interpreter (without collisions with the globally installed ones). We can install and switch between multiple
versions of Python using pyenv <span class="citation">(Yamashita, Stephenson, and et al. <a href="#ref-pyenv" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> or Poetry <span class="citation">(Kalnytskyi <a href="#ref-poetry" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-poetry" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, or a more general-purpose tool like asdf <span class="citation">(Manohar <a href="#ref-asdf" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> that
supports multiple runtime versions for the most used interpreters, compilers and development tools. If our needs are too
complex for this approach, we might consider tools such as Pipenv <span class="citation">(Reitz and Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) <a href="#ref-pipenv" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Conda <span class="citation">(Anaconda <a href="#ref-conda" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-conda" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>. Conda in particular has
a broad support for machine learning and data science applications <span class="citation">(Anaconda <a href="#ref-conda-data-science" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-conda-data-science" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> but is rather cumbersome to
use. The R counterpart of Pipenv is the packrat package <span class="citation">(Ushey et al. <a href="#ref-packrat" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, which also uses a locally installed R interpreter.
</p>
<p>
Automated tests are another key feature of modern practices for developing (Section <a href="writing-code.html#versioning">6.5</a>), refactoring
(Section <a href="writing-code.html#refactoring">6.7</a>) and maintaining software (Section <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#testing">9.4</a>). Each test should be run in a clean
environment such as a container that is re-created at each run: we want to avoid the execution of one test influencing
the results of another. (The automated and reproducible deployment practices we discussed in Chapter
<a href="deploying-code.html#deploying-code">7</a> are a key enabler of automated testing!) Test results should be included as pass/fail by the CI/CD
pipeline to facilitate code review (Section <a href="writing-code.html#code-review">6.6</a>) and to ensure that the pipeline is always in a
functioning state. There are many frameworks and libraries that we can use to implement the types of tests described in
Section <a href="troubleshooting-code.html#testing">9.4</a>. For individual modules, we can use the unittest <span class="citation">(Python Software Foundation <a href="#ref-unittest" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-unittest" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span> and doctest <span class="citation">(Python Software Foundation <a href="#ref-doctest" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-doctest" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> packages in
the Python standard library, the testthat R <span class="citation">(Wickham, RStudio, and R Core Team <a href="#ref-testthat" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> package and the Julia test module.
</p>
<p>

We should also test that the machine learning pipeline as a whole works as expected. Tools like Airflow <span class="citation">(The Apache Software Foundation <a href="#ref-airflow" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-airflow" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, DVC
and Pachyderm <span class="citation">(Pachyderm <a href="#ref-pachyderm" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> use the DAG that maps the dependencies between the modules to allow for local, iterative
testing. In DVC and Pachyderm, dependencies are specified in a declarative configuration file (say, <code>dvc.yaml</code> for DVC)
which can be either written manually or built programmatically using helper commands. DVC does not have any built-in
support for testing, so we should instrument modules ourselves (for unit tests) and embed the whole pipeline in a
testing framework (for integration, system and acceptance tests). In Airflow, the pipeline is implemented in Python code
and dependencies are encoded in a dedicated <code>DAG</code> object: this makes it easy to test individual modules with unittest
and to validate data with frameworks such as Great Expectations <span class="citation">(Superconductive <a href="#ref-ge" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. As for pipelines running on GitHub, GitLab or
Jenkins, we can use actions and runners <span class="citation">(Gitlab <a href="#ref-gitlab-runner" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-gitlab-runner" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>; Nektos <a href="#ref-act" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>; Jenkins <a href="#ref-jenkinsfile-runner" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-jenkinsfile-runner" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> that, albeit with some limitations,
can run the complete pipeline or some of its parts using containers. Another alternative is to validate the pipeline
directly by iteratively committing changes to a test branch and pushing them to the mainline branch to force the CI to
run any tests that may be relevant. Jenkins also provides a testing framework for implementing unit tests on the
configuration and on the conditional logic of the pipeline code and a command-line tool for linting the pipeline. GitLab
provides APIs to trigger validation and linting for the same purpose.


</p>
<p>
Enforcing code styles and standards, which we discussed in Section <a href="writing-code.html#coding-standards">6.3</a>, is a crucial complement to
testing to ensure that we produce maintainable, working software. Pylint <span class="citation">(Logilab and PyCQA and contributors <a href="#ref-pylint" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> is the reference static code analyser
and linter for Python: it is based on PEP-8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8), the official document that contains the
guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. An alternative is Flake8 <span class="citation">(Stapleton Cordasco <a href="#ref-flake8" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, which builds on other
tools such as pycodestyle (a style guide checker), pyflakes (a source files checker for errors) and mccabe (a tool to
check the complexity of the code). A comprehensive linting step for Python code should apply a sequence of tools such as
the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>isort <span class="citation">(Crosley <a href="#ref-isort" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> to sort imports alphabetically and separate into sections by type;</li>
<li>black <span class="citation">(Langa and et al. <a href="#ref-black" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> to format the code;</li>
<li>flake8 to check the code style;</li>
<li>pylint as the final step to run static code analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The styler package <span class="citation">(Müller and Walthert <a href="#ref-r-styler" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-r-styler" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, which enforces compliance with the tidyverse style guide <span class="citation">(Wickham <a href="#ref-r-style" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-r-style" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>, and the lintr
package <span class="citation">(Hester et al. <a href="#ref-r-lintr" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, which performs static code analysis and which identifies syntax errors and possible semantic issues,
fill the roles of the Python packages above for R code. Both lintr (see <code>vignette("continuous-integration"</code>)) and
styler support CI/CD integration <span class="citation">(Müller and Walthert <a href="#ref-r-styler-cicd" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-r-styler-cicd" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>, accept user-provided code style policies and integrate with RStudio.

</p>
<p>
Writing documentation and keeping it up-to-date is also key to maintaining machine learning pipelines over time.
Documentation should be versioned like code and kept as close as possible to the code it refers to. Documentation on
module, function and class interfaces or on method definitions can placed in both Python <span class="citation">(Goodger and Rossum <a href="#ref-py-docstrings" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Julia
<span class="citation">(Krämer <a href="#ref-jl-docstrings" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> code using structured comments in the docstring or native Sphinx format; Sphinx <span class="citation">(Brandl and the Sphinx Team <a href="#ref-sphinx" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> can then
compile those comments into documents in various file formats via the Sphinx <code>autodoc</code> extension (see Section
<a href="documenting-code.html#apidocs">8.2</a> for an example). Sphinx can also be used to (re)compile documentation automatically using CI (with “Read
the Docs” <span class="citation">(Read the Docs <a href="#ref-readthedocs" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>) and to render OpenAPI specification files as static HTML pages <span class="citation">(Kalnytskyi <a href="#ref-sphinxcontrib-redoc" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-sphinxcontrib-redoc" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>)</span>. The
OpenAPI specification files can in turn be automatically generated from docstrings using Sphinx <span class="citation">(Kalnytskyi <a href="#ref-sphinxcontrib-openapi" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a><a href="#ref-sphinxcontrib-openapi" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>,
Apispec <span class="citation">(Loria and et al. <a href="#ref-apispec" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> or a framework such as FastApi <span class="citation">(Ramírez <a href="#ref-fastapi" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and Flask <span class="citation">(Pallets Team <a href="#ref-flask" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In R, we can use comments in the Doxygen <span class="citation">(van Heesch <a href="#ref-doxygen" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> format for the same purpose: they can be parsed by the Roxygen2
package <span class="citation">(Wickham, Danenberg, et al. <a href="#ref-roxygen2" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> to generate R documentation in various formats as discussed in Section <a href="documenting-code.html#apidocs">8.2</a>.
