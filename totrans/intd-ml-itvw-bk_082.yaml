    (quicksort, radix sort), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra’s, A*), tree algorithms
    (pre-, in-, post-order traversal), and solutions to popular problems such as the
    stable marriage problem and traveling salesman problem. You will probably never
    have to implement them since there already exist many efficient implementations,
    but it’s important to understand their underlying design principles and implementation
    tradeoffs in case you have to make similar decisions in your job.

    as dynamic programming, recursions, string manipulation, matrix multiplication,
    regular expression, and memory allocation. Below are some of the questions that
    you might want to go over to refresh your memory.

    of a line should be configurable.

- en: You have 1 million text files, each is a news article scraped from various news
    sites. Since news sites often report the same news, even the same articles, many
    of the files have content very similar to each other. Write a program to filter
    out these files so that the end result contains only files that are sufficiently
    different from each other in the language of your choice. You’re free to choose
    a metric to define the “similarity” of content between files.
