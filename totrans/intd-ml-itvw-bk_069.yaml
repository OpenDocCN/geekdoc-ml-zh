    dismiss a question as unimportant. If an interviewer asks you a question, it’s
    important to them.

    Artificial Intelligence, refrain from saying “AI is the new electricity.” This
    is your chance for your own journey and personality to shine.

- en: Don’t aggressively steer the conversation to topics that you know well. It’s
    okay to do it subtly, but don’t ignore the interviewer’s questions. Don’t change
    the subject. A good interviewer will eventually guide the interview to areas that
    you know about.^([56](#fn_56))

    anyone during your interviews. You can talk about the challenges you face when
    working with them, but you don’t want to be the person who finds faults in everyone.
    There’s this saying: if everyone around you seems to be a problem, you’re the
    problem.'

    to be more junior than the candidate. They might not have your credentials or
    experiences, but they still know things that you don’t.

    Interviewers aren’t allowed to ask for this kind of information because it’s irrelevant
    to the job and has the potential for bias.

    recruiter or the company’s operation staff.

    get questions below your ability because the company might be pegging you down

    companies. If that’s your dream company, check in with them a year or so later.

    For example, I’d try to gauge their knowledge in dropouts for RNNs and they’d
    say: “Dropouts aren’t a big problem for RNNs, vanishing gradients are” and talk
    about vanishing gradients instead.'
