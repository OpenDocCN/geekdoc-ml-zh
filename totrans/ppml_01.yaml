    sexiest job of the 21st century” (Harvard Business Review [2012](#ref-sexy-job))
    or “Data is the new oil” (The Economist [2017](#ref-new-oil)) has become such
    a cliché that any audience (in business and academia alike) will collectively
    roll their eyes in exasperation. And for good reason. Likewise, we do not believe
    radiologists or lorry drivers will be replaced by artificial intelligence and
    out of a job for the foreseeable future, and we are not alone in realising the
    limits of machine learning (The Economist [2020](#ref-ailimits)).'

    on many aspects of our lives. It has taken the pre-existing trends of using data
    and analytics (under the banner of “data mining”, “big data” and similar buzzwords)
    to inform business decisions and drive scientific discovery, and made them ubiquitous.
    Machine learning has combined the mathematical rigour of information theory and
    statistics, the computational aspects of computer science and the goal-driven
    flexibility of optimisation theory, redefining how we work with data.

    been the clash between their respective cultures, which has been well summarised
    by Leo Breiman in “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” (Breiman [2001](#ref-two-cultures)[b](#ref-two-cultures)).
    On top of that, there is a tension between machine learning practice in the industry
    and academia: the latter strongly values producing novel models and theoretical
    results, while the former is driven by the need to produce practical results that
    have business value. With so many different perspectives, it is a wonder that
    a rough consensus on what machine learning is has actually evolved! (Personally,
    our red line is conflating deep learning with machine learning. There is life
    beyond deep neural networks!)'

    a remarkably small role compared to other disciplines. Machine learning, after
    all, is “a technique that allows computer systems to improve with experience and
    data” (Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville [2016](#ref-goodfellow)). Therefore,
    there is a presumption that one will interact with a computer system, which in
    turn happens by engineering a piece of software that communicates to the computer
    system what it is supposed to do. The quality of this engineering is crucial in
    both academia and industry. In academia, software quality issues are one of the
    underlying causes of the “reproducibility crisis” (Nature [2016](#ref-repro1);
    Tatman, VanderPlas, and Dane [2018](#ref-repro2)). In industry, poor engineering
    leads to lower practical and computational performance (Kang et al. [2021](#ref-kenett-paper)),
    to a quick accumulation of technical debt (Sculley et al. [2015](#ref-hidden-debt))
    and sometimes to catastrophic failures with costs in the millions (.Seven [2014](#ref-knights-capital);
    The Register [2020](#ref-twilio-breach); VPNOverview [2022](#ref-switch-breach);
    Sherman [2022](#ref-zillow)). There is, of course, a sizeable body of accumulated
    wisdom on how to architect and write software in foundational books like *The
    Pragmatic Programmer* (Thomas and Hunt [2019](#ref-pragpro)) and *A Philosophy
    of Software Design* (Ousterhout [2018](#ref-philo)). However, these books are
    written with business software in mind, and we find that they do not capture or
    touch only tangentially on key practices that go a long way towards successfully
    implementing and deploying machine learning models. Analysis of algorithms; matching
    data and algorithms with appropriate hardware; embracing data as part of the software;
    testing and documenting algorithms and their implementations; modularising and
    building pipelines; and, last but not least, naming variables. From our experience
    in academia and in the industry, engineering software and teaching software engineering
    to students and new staff alike, these topics are often not given the importance
    they deserve. We hope to convince the readers of this book that the viability
    of any software that analyses data, whether you call it machine learning, data
    science or business analytics, depends crucially on putting careful thought into
    these engineering practices. We do not aim to be prescriptive: the individual
    practices that we discuss will be more or less relevant in different settings,
    and can be implemented with a variety of software tools. On the contrary, we want
    our readers to think about what we wrote in the context of their own experience
    and to figure out which parts apply and which do not!'
