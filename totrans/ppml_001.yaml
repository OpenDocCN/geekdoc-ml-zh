    its ecosystem.

- en: We don't assume any prior knowledge of Rust, but we assume you know at least
    another programming language. We also don't assume any prior knowledge of systems
    programming or memory management. Those topics will be covered in the course.

- en: You'll build up your Rust knowledge in small, manageable steps. By the end of
    the course, you will have solved ~100 exercises, enough to feel comfortable working
    on small to medium-sized Rust projects.
