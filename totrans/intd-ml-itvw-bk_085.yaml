- en: If our world is run by data, then data structures are what keep us from descending
    into chaos. From the dawn of the digital age, the best minds of computer science
    have kept themselves up at night thinking of efficient ways to store and manipulate
    data. Data structures are even more important in machine learning as the field
    is fueled by big data.

- en: While there are classical data structures that have stood the test of time,
    developing new data structures and improving on the existing ones are never-ending
    battles as new formats are introduced and new data are generated at a scale never
    seen before. Your familiarity with existing data structures, understanding of
    how they are implemented, and intuition on what data structures to use and when
    to use them will be highly valuable.

    to implement them yourself, either on a coding exercise website or locally, and
    compare with known implementation.

    ubiquitous CSV format and web- and serialization-friendly JSON format. Both CSV
    and JSON are examples of the traditional row-based file formats: data is stored
    and often indexed row-by-row.'

- en: In recent years, the column-based format has become more and more common, as
    it allows big data applications to quickly extract one feature from all the data
    points by calling the column corresponding to that feature. Popular data frameworks
    for machine learning include `pandas` and `dask` are optimized for column-based
    operations. The two common column-based file formats are Parquet, championed by
    Apache Hadoop, and ORC, championed by Apache Hive.

- en: Row-based data formats are more efficient for writing while column-based formats
    are more efficient for reading. If your data is write-once-read-many, use column-based.
    If it requires regular rewriting, opt for row-based.
