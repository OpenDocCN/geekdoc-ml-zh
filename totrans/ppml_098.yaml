    complexity. Take time to know your tools: dive deep into `tokio`''s documentation
    and get familiar with its primitives to make the most out of it.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind, as well, that there is ongoing work at the language and `std`
    level to streamline and "complete" Rust's asynchronous story. You may experience
    some rough edges in your day-to-day work due to some of these missing pieces.

- en: Some primitives (e.g. timers, I/O) are not portable across runtimes. Trying
    to mix runtimes is likely to cause you pain. Trying to write code that's runtime
    agnostic can significantly increase the complexity of your codebase. Avoid it
    if you can.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An `AsyncIterator` is, conceptually, an iterator that yields new items asynchronously.
    There is ongoing design work, but no consensus (yet). If you're using `tokio`,
    refer to [`tokio_stream`](https://docs.rs/tokio-stream/latest/tokio_stream/) as
    your go-to interface.
