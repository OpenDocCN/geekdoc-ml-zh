    provided heat sink during camera applications. Its design is specifically tailored
    to address cooling needs, particularly during intensive operations such as camera
    usage.

    the ESP32S3 chip, the primary source of heat. Proper alignment ensures optimal
    heat dissipation, and **it is essential to keep the BAT pins as unobstructed as
    possible**.

    the thermal pad, but in this situation, be aware that all pins became unavailable.
