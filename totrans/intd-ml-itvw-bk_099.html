<li>[E] When building a neural network, should you overfit or underfit it first?</li>
<li>[E] Write the vanilla gradient update.</li>
<li>Neural network in simple Numpy.<ol>
<li>[E] Write in plain NumPy the forward and backward pass for a two-layer feed-forward neural network with a ReLU layer in between.</li>
<li>[M] Implement vanilla dropout for the forward and backward pass in NumPy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Activation functions.<ol>
<li>[E] Draw the graphs for sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and leaky ReLU.</li>
<li>[E] Pros and cons of each activation function.</li>
<li>[E] Is ReLU differentiable? What to do when it’s not differentiable?</li>
<li>[M] Derive derivatives for sigmoid function <script type="math/tex; ">\sigma(x)</script> when <script type="math/tex; ">x</script> is a vector.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[E] What’s the motivation for skip connection in neural works?</li>
<li>Vanishing and exploding gradients.<ol>
<li>[E] How do we know that gradients are exploding? How do we prevent it?</li>
<li>[E] Why are RNNs especially susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[M] Weight normalization separates a weight vector’s norm from its gradient. How would it help with training?</li>
<li>[M] When training a large neural network, say a language model with a billion parameters, you evaluate your model on a validation set at the end of every epoch. You realize that your validation loss is often lower than your train loss. What might be happening?</li>
<li>[E] What criteria would you use for early stopping?</li>
<li>[E] Gradient descent vs SGD vs mini-batch SGD.</li>
<li>[H] It’s a common practice to train deep learning models using epochs: we sample batches from data <strong>without</strong> replacement. Why would we use epochs instead of just sampling data <strong>with</strong> replacement?</li>
<li>[M] Your model’ weights fluctuate a lot during training. How does that affect your model’s performance? What to do about it?</li>
<li>Learning rate.<ol>
<li>[E] Draw a graph number of training epochs vs training error for when the learning rate is:<ol>
<li>too high</li>
<li>too low</li>
<li>acceptable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[E] What’s learning rate warmup? Why do we need it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[E] Compare batch norm and layer norm.</li>
<li>[M] Why is squared L2 norm sometimes preferred to L2 norm for regularizing neural networks?</li>
<li>[E] Some models use weight decay: after each gradient update, the weights are multiplied by a factor slightly less than 1. What is this useful for?</li>
<li>It’s a common practice for the learning rate to be reduced throughout the training.<ol>
<li>[E] What’s the motivation?</li>
<li>[M] What might be the exceptions?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Batch size.<ol>
<li>[E] What happens to your model training when you decrease the batch size to 1?</li>
<li>[E] What happens when you use the entire training data in a batch?</li>
<li>[M] How should we adjust the learning rate as we increase or decrease the batch size?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[M] Why is Adagrad sometimes favored in problems with sparse gradients?</li>
<li>Adam vs. SGD.<ol>
<li>[M] What can you say about the ability to converge and generalize of Adam vs. SGD?</li>
<li>[M] What else can you say about the difference between these two optimizers? </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[M] With model parallelism, you might update your model weights using the gradients from each machine asynchronously or synchronously. What are the pros and cons of asynchronous SGD vs. synchronous SGD?</li>
<li>[M] Why shouldn’t we have two consecutive linear layers in a neural network?</li>
<li>[M] Can a neural network with only RELU (non-linearity) act as a linear classifier?</li>
<li>[M] Design the smallest neural network that can function as an XOR gate.</li>
<li>[E] Why don’t we just initialize all weights in a neural network to zero?</li>
<li>Stochasticity.<ol>
<li>[M] What are some sources of randomness in a neural network?</li>
<li>[M] Sometimes stochasticity is desirable when training neural networks. Why is that?</li>

<li>[M] How to prevent them?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pruning.<ol>
<li>[M] Pruning is a popular technique where certain weights of a neural network are set to 0. Why is it desirable?</li>
<li>[M] How do you choose what to prune from a neural network?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>[H] Under what conditions would it be possible to recover training data from the weight checkpoints?</li>
<li>[H] Why do we try to reduce the size of a big trained model through techniques such as knowledge distillation instead of just training a small model from the beginning?</li>
