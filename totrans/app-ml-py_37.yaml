  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do it all the time. In fact, I also make workflows to make fake data so that
    I can rapidly make a variety of new datasets fit-for-purpose of the specific model
    testing and educational content. But I find that often I need to defend my fake
    data generation habit with,

- en: '**Avoid the Inference Problem** - when we work with real data, we often cannot
    know the truth. Our subsurface data is often very limited! Perhaps we can rewind
    the clock and test against the newest data, or mask a region for testing our ability
    to estimate spatially away from data. But, we can never completely avoid the inference
    problem, i.e., did our model perform poorly because we used the wrong data or
    made the wrong model choices?'

- en: '**Working in Expected Value** - it is possible to be lucky, to run a proposed
    method on a single dataset and see great improvement vs. the established method,
    and then on the next run with a new dataset to see worsening! A data scientist
    bases their work in probability and statistics; therefore, we know that we need
    many replicates. We can generate an ensemble of dataset cases and then summarize
    model performance in expected value for greater rigor.'

- en: '**Test a Wide Range of Conditions** - how does your model handle data noise?
    redundant features? nonlinearity in the relationships between your features? sparse
    data? It would be quite difficult to curate a sufficient number of datasets to
    test the potentially wide range of modeling conditions. With fake data you can
    turn the dial and evaluate the impact on your model for any combination and severity
    of conditions, and even test your model to failure like the ‘Myth Busters’ approach.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Tune the Data Difficulty** - this follows from the previous point, but it
    has to do with tuning the modeling difficulty. With fake data you can give yourself
    perfectly ideal data with no bias, no error, great coverage and even low dimensionality.
    In fact, my fake data generation algorithms often starts there and then performs
    operations to imposed biased sampling, add measurement error, reduce coverage
    and even add additional features. Remember it is very easy to take perfect data
    and wreck it, but generally impossible to take poor data and improve it.'

    most of this data is not in public domain. I appreciate and respect the working
    professionals that take the time to obtain the approvals for my students and I
    to use their real data, but it would not be possible to use this data in my free,
    online educational content. To support my open education efforts, I need reproducible
    course notes; therefore, I need to be able to freely share the datasets.'

    not just include a ‘z’ (*‘zed’* - shout out to my fellow Canadians) or an iz axes
    in the NumPy ndarray object?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many spatial data analytics and geostatistics methods have computational complexity
    with a \(n_z\) term, i.e., by adding a minimal number of \(z\) layers like 10,
    we increase the run time by an order of magnitude. Sure I love cool hardware,
    but for the purpose of education in my classrooms and around the world I would
    rather err on the side of very easy to run, very low computational complexity
    for very fast run times.

    know the truth. Our subsurface data is often very limited! Perhaps we can rewind
    the clock and test against the newest data, or mask a region for testing our ability
    to estimate spatially away from data. But, we can never completely avoid the inference
    problem, i.e., did our model perform poorly because we used the wrong data or
    made the wrong model choices?'

    method on a single dataset and see great improvement vs. the established method,
    and then on the next run with a new dataset to see worsening! A data scientist
    bases their work in probability and statistics; therefore, we know that we need
    many replicates. We can generate an ensemble of dataset cases and then summarize
    model performance in expected value for greater rigor.'

    turn the dial and evaluate the impact on your model for any combination and severity

    has to do with tuning the modeling difficulty. With fake data you can give yourself
    perfectly ideal data with no bias, no error, great coverage and even low dimensionality.
    In fact, my fake data generation algorithms often starts there and then performs
    operations to imposed biased sampling, add measurement error, reduce coverage
    and even add additional features. Remember it is very easy to take perfect data
    and wreck it, but generally impossible to take poor data and improve it.'

    but for the purpose of education in my classrooms and around the world I would
    rather err on the side of very easy to run, very low computational complexity

    fractures, and often limited matrix flow rates, unconventional reservoir forecasting
    can be quite challenging.
