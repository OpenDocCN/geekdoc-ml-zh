<p>Linear regression can be extended in a number of ways to fit various modeling needs. <a class="reference internal" href="s1/regularized.html"><span class="doc">Regularized regression</span></a> penalizes the magnitude of the regression coefficients to avoid <em>overfitting</em>, which is particularly helpful for models using a large number of predictors. <a class="reference internal" href="s1/bayesian.html"><span class="doc">Bayesian regression</span></a> places a prior distribution on the regression coefficients in order to reconcile existing beliefs about these parameters with information gained from new data. Finally, generalized linear models (<a class="reference internal" href="s1/GLMs.html"><span class="doc">GLMs</span></a>) expand on ordinary linear regression by changing the assumed error structure and allowing for the expected value of the target variable to be a nonlinear function of the predictors. These extensions are described, derived, and demonstrated in detail this chapter.</p>
