- en: Machine learning has revolutionized science, from folding proteins and predicting
    tornadoes to studying human nature. While science has always had an intimate relationship
    with prediction, machine learning amplified this focus. But can this hyper-focus
    on prediction be justified? Can a machine learning model be part of a scientific
    model? Or are we on the wrong track?

- en: In this book, we explore and justify supervised machine learning in science.
    However, a naive application of supervised learning won’t get you far because
    machine learning in raw form is unsuitable for science. After all, it lacks interpretability,
    causality, uncertainty quantification, and many more desirable attributes. Yet,
    we already have all the puzzle pieces needed to improve machine learning, from
    incorporating domain knowledge to creating robust, interpretable, and causal models.
    The problem is that the solutions are scattered everywhere.
