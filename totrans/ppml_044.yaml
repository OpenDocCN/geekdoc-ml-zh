- en: You may be wondering—what can you actually **do** with an enum?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: A `match` statement that lets you compare a Rust value against a series of **patterns**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of it as a type-level `if`. If `status` is a `Done` variant, execute
    the first block; if it's a `InProgress` or `ToDo` variant, execute the second
    block.

- en: Codebases evolve over time—you might add a new status down the line, e.g. `Blocked`.
    The Rust compiler will emit an error for every single `match` statement that's
    missing logic for the new variant. That's why Rust developers often sing the praises
    of "compiler-driven refactoring"—the compiler tells you what to do next, you just
    have to fix what it reports.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The `_` pattern matches anything that wasn't matched by the previous patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using this catch-all pattern, you _won't_ get the benefits of compiler-driven
    refactoring. If you add a new enum variant, the compiler _won't_ tell you that
    you're not handling it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're keen on correctness, avoid using catch-alls. Leverage the compiler
    to re-examine all matching sites and determine how new enum variants should be
    handled.
