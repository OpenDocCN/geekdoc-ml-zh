<h1>Traits</h1>

<p>In the previous chapter we covered the basics of Rust's type and ownership system.<br/>
It's time to dig deeper: we'll explore <strong>traits</strong>, Rust's take on interfaces.</p>
<p>Once you learn about traits, you'll start seeing their fingerprints all over the place.<br/>
In fact, you've already seen traits in action throughout the previous chapter, e.g. <code>.into()</code> invocations as well
as operators like <code>==</code> and <code>+</code>.</p>
<p>On top of traits as a concept, we'll also cover some of the key traits that are defined in Rust's standard library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operator traits (e.g. <code>Add</code>, <code>Sub</code>, <code>PartialEq</code>, etc.)</li>
<li><code>From</code> and <code>Into</code>, for infallible conversions</li>
<li><code>Clone</code> and <code>Copy</code>, for copying values</li>
<li><code>Deref</code> and deref coercion</li>
<li><code>Sized</code>, to mark types with a known size</li>
<li><code>Drop</code>, for custom cleanup logic</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we'll be talking about conversions, we'll seize the opportunity to plug some of the "knowledge gaps"
from the previous chapter—e.g. what is <code>"A title"</code>, exactly? Time to learn more about slices too!</p>
