- en: As the research community takes the “bigger, better” approach, new models often
    require a massive amount of data and tens of millions of dollars in computing.
    The estimated market cost to train DeepMind’s AlphaStar and OpenAI’s GPT-3 is
    in the tens of millions each^([4](#fn_4))^([5](#fn_5)). Most companies and academic
    institutions can’t afford to pursue pure research.

- en: Outside academic institutions, there are only a handful of machine learning
    research labs in the world. Most of these labs are funded by corporations with
    deep pockets such as Alphabet (Google Brain, DeepMind), Microsoft, Facebook, Tencent^([6](#fn_6)).
    You can find these labs by browsing the affiliations of published papers at major
    academic conferences including [NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ACL](https://www.guide2research.com/topconf/machine-learning).
    In 2019 and 2020, Alphabet accounts for over 10% of all papers at NeurIPS[[1](https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1170174478304759809/photo/1),

- en: Not all these industry labs publish papers -- companies like Apple and Tesla
    are notoriously secretive. Even if an industry lab publishes, it might only publish
    a portion of its research. Before joining an industry lab, you might want to consider
    its publishing policy. Joining a secretive lab might mean that you won’t be able
    to explain to other people what you’ve been working on or what you’re capable
    of doing.
