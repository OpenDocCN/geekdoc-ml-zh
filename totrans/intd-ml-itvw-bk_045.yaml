- en: Companies want to know about you, your personality, your grit, your strengths,
    and your weaknesses. Directly asking a candidate for their strengths and weaknesses
    often yields poor results -- most people are reluctant to admit their flaws and
    too shy to boast about their strengths. Interviewers, therefore, might frame the
    questions differently.

- en: 'Senior interviewers tend to have a go-to question that they believe reveals
    the most about a person. In his book *Zero to One*, Peter Thiel revealed that
    he asked everyone he interviewed: “*What important truth do very few people agree
    with you on?*” This question is hard to answer as it first requires you to know
    what most people agree on, be able to think independently and be confident enough
    to express it.'

    brilliant jerks -- high performers who are rude and unpleasant to work with --
    which contributes to the alleged toxic culture of the tech industry. However,
    in recent years, many tech companies including Netflix have made the commitment
    to not hire jerks, no matter how brilliant they are.
