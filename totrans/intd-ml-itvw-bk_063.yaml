- en: Given the plethora of available resources online, it can be disorienting trying
    to figure out which resources to focus on. The Kaggle’s state of data science
    and machine learning survey 2017 asked respondents about the learning methods
    that they found the most helpful. Here is a [visualization of the responses](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-8c0ea546ab81),
    created by my previous colleague [Jack Cook](https://jackcook.com/).

- en: The most effective learning methods are doing projects, taking courses, and
    just spending a ton of time on StackOverFlow (SO). Kaggle competitions rank high
    on the list but since the respondents are Kaggle users, their answers are biased.
    A college education is perceived as slightly more useful than watching YouTube
    tutorials and reading blogs. The least useful methods in this survey are podcasts,
    newsletters, and conferences.

- en: Attending conferences might not be useful for building your skill sets, but
    very useful for building up your network. Getting published at conferences is
    a great way to put your name out there and signal that your knowledge of the field
    is in-depth enough to come up with original research ideas.
