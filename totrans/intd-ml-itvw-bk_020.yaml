- en: While role definitions are useful for career orientation, a role definition
    poorly reflects what you do on the job. Two people with the same title on the
    same team might do very different things. Two people doing similar things at different
    companies might have different titles. In 2018, Lyft decided to rename their role
    of “Data Analyst” to “Data Scientist”, and “Data Scientist” to “Research Scientist”^([13](#fn_13)),
    a move likely motivated by the job market’s demands, which shows how interchangeable
    roles are.
