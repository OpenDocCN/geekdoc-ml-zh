- en: A *classifier* is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to identify
    an observation’s membership in one of two or more groups. In other words, the
    target variable in classification represents a *class* from a finite set rather
    than a continuous number. Examples include detecting spam emails or identifying
    hand-written digits.

- en: This chapter and the next cover *discriminative* and *generative* classification,
    respectively. Discriminative classification directly models an observation’s class
    membership as a function of its input variables. Generative classification instead
    views the input variables as a function of the observation’s class. It first models
    the prior probability that an observation belongs to a given class, then calculates
    the probability of observing the observation’s input variables conditional on
    its class, and finally solves for the posterior probability of belonging to a
    given class using Bayes’ Rule. More on that in the following chapter.

- en: 'The most common method in this chapter by far is logistic regression. This
    is not, however, the only discriminative classifier. This chapter also introduces
    two others: the *Perceptron Algorithm* and *Fisher’s Linear Discriminant*.'
